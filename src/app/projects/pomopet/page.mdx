## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Being able to manage your time, study, and get work done is something that every student needs to do to be successful, but this can be difficult for a multitude of reasons. From structuring their schedules to effectively completing assignments, to lack of motivation, or feelings of isolation from tackling everything alone, all of these factors eventually lead to burnout and poor productivity. 

Current platforms focus on only tracking individual productivity, but over-rely on self-accountability to consistently use the app and build and maintain long-term motivation, leading to an eventual return to poor productivity due to not feeling a need to get things done. 
 
Pomopet combines a physical light-up companion that pairs with a social platform to encourage and motivate users to improve productivity through gamification and social accountability. Allowing friends to form groups to work alongside each other toward goals, unlocking collaborative rewards, gamifying productivity, and holding each other accountable to achieve their productivity goals. 


</ProjectImageBlock>

## Design Walkthrough

While using Pomopet, users will need to know their priorities when it comes to their study sessions. What they want to focus on, how they want to complete it, and when they are most available, are all factors they need to take into consideration. Staying productive, whether by themselves or with other collaborators, is also something they need to be aware of, and know how it impacts their overall progress. That’s why our focus tasks revolve around helping users create a focused & informed plan to manage their goals, and collaborate with other users to stay productive.


### Creating an informed plan to manage your goals

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: t1walkthrough1,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "This caption is applied to the entire block of images. " +
        "See that it spans across the area of the images."
    }
    width={1200}
    maxHeight={"800"}
>

When first creating a plan, the user navigates from the home page to begin creating the goals they want to fulfill during their study session. They can adjust things like how many goals they want to set, how long their study session will be for, and what colors their Pomopet will change to during the session and breaks. After setting their preferences, they can save them, and are placed into the session.


</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: t1walkthrough2,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
    }}
    caption={
        "A good caption supports helps a reader understand what is important. " +
        "It thus supports skimming and also provides an emphasis on key points of related text."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

After completing their session, the user completes a reflection activity to see what goals they achieved, and input any feedback they had from their session. After completing the reflection, they can claim their session reward, and move back to the home page.


</ProjectImageBlock>

### Collaborating with other users to stay productive

Users can access their group of friends, or join a group by using the group code provided, and communicate with them using messages. Past group chats of sections you’ve worked in are gray, while pink chats are ones associated with your current working section.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: t2walkthrough1,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "The text above is outside the image block, then we have these full width images."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

You and others in the group chat can decide what reward you want to set for completing a study session, and once decided, can navigate to the home page to start working in the session. Other group members can change the reward set up until the session begins. After the session starts, the users once again can set the goals they want to achieve during the session, the length of time they have, and the colors of their Pomopets, like in the first focus task.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: t2walkthrough2,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "The text above is outside the image block, then we have these full width images."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

After the session ends, the users fill out the reflection and claim their reward, while their group reward remains locked until the complete end of the session. When they navigate back to the home page, they receive their group reward.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: t2walkthrough3,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "The text above is outside the image block, then we have these full width images."
    }
    width={20}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

Users can talk about their group reward after receiving it, and can use the currency they claimed from the session to buy items to customize their pet’s home with.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: t2walkthrough4,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "The text above is outside the image block, then we have these full width images."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

After purchasing, they can position & orient the furniture by accessing their inventory, and can later change it by editing the room.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: t2walkthrough5,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "The text above is outside the image block, then we have these full width images."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research began with trying to understand why people would lose motivation and procrastinate on assignments and why they would leave things to do last minute. By doing so, we can reverse engineering ways to make the user more engaged with their work. We also wanted to know if certain motivation methods were popular or not, and if it would be a good consistent source of motivation. To conduct our research, we decided on doing 1:1 in person interviews with our participants. This allows for deep conversations and would allow us to deeply understand how people approach their work.The main demographic for our research are students at the UW who at least have been there for more than a year, as it would mean they had time to adjust to the high education environment, and would have had the opportunity to lose motivation and procrastinate. 


### Collaboration over Competition

From our design research, one key insight that came up was the preference of collaboration over competition when it came to a source of motivation. Although there was a general consensus that competition was a source of motivation, participants believed that it was not long term and could potentially become toxic. On the contrary, collaboration was much more preferred as the pressure from working with others is less emotionally taxing compared to competition, and can be a long term motivation. From this insight, we wanted to remove all forms of competition, and to find ways for users to collaborate with other users and friends. This resulted in users in Pomopet collaborating with others during study sessions.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: insight1,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}

### Value in Internal Motivation

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: insight2,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

One participant mentioned that they found value in self-growth and finding satisfaction in accomplishments. They believed that there is motivation in self improvements and bettering oneself. Another user found satisfaction in being able to see progression and accomplishments, similar to something like BeReal or Spotify Wrap. To respond to this, we added ways for users to reflect on their study sessions so they can understand how well they did and how much they accomplished. This is then recorded and users can look back on it.


### Rewards to Encourage Task Completion

Participants generally viewed rewards as a good incentive to encourage task completion and as a sustainable form of motivation. Participants would usually set up rewards that they would treat themselves with after completing their tasks. Other participants also wanted to see something tangible as a result of their hard work after completing tasks. This encouraged us to implement a gamified reward system for completing tasks and also ways for groups to form rewards after completing tasks. This way users have ways to feel rewarded in both the app and in real life.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our initial paper prototypes explored the physical-to-digital interaction, using a plush toy to control the app's timer

Our iterative design process began with creating low-fidelity paper prototypes to test the core interaction of physically "squishing" a toy to activate a digital timer. We refined these designs through a heuristic evaluation to address navigation consistency, followed by usability testing with target users to validate our task flows. These evaluations revealed a disconnect between our initial "strict" productivity philosophy and the realistic needs of students, prompting significant changes as we transitioned into our final high-fidelity digital mockup.
