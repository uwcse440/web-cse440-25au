## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Managing medication can affect people in a lot of different ways, and it is often hard to 
keep track of how you feel from day to day. Most people want to notice patterns in their mood,
symptoms, or side effects, but daily journaling usually feels confusing or repetitive. 
A lot of the tools that already exist do not help users stay consistent, and the information 
they collect does not translate into anything useful when talking with a trusted or medical 
individual. Because of this, it becomes easy to lose track of important details about how the 
medication is actually affecting them. 


RxFlect focuses on making this whole process easier. The app helps users reflect on their physical 
and mental well-being with guided prompts that adjust to how much they want to reflect that day. 
It also keeps track of symptoms and experiences in the background so users can later create clear
and simple reports. These reports highlight trends, changes, and anything important that might 
come up during conversations with healthcare providers or trusted individuals. 

Our goal with Rxflect is to make daily journaling feel manageable and to give users 
something that actually helps them understand their own medication journey. 
We want the process to feel smoother, more personal, and less overwhelming so 
people can stay consistent and get real value from the reflections they record. 

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Design Walkthrough

RxFlect is built around two core experiences that help users better understand their medication 
journey. The first supports daily reflections and journaling so users can keep track of how they 
feel. The second helps them turn their reflection into clear reports so they can share 
with someone they trust. These tasks work together to make tracking symptoms and changes feel easier and more meaningful.  

### Expressing Their Well-Being Through Guided Journaling

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "This caption is applied to the entire block of images. " +
        "See that it spans across the area of the images."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

When users first begin using RxFlect, they set up a few pieces of basic information like their
profile, medications, and the conditions they want to track. 
This allows the app to personalize prompts and reports later on. 
Users can also set journaling reminders so they can stay consistent without feeling pressured.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

Once reminders are set, the journaling flow becomes the main way users reflect on their day. 
When they start a journal entry, RxFlect asks them to choose how much they want to write. 
Light mode is for quick check-ins, and Heavy mode is for days when users want to go deeper.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x800,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
    }}
    caption={
        "A good caption supports helps a reader understand what is important. " +
        "It thus supports skimming and also provides an emphasis on key points of related text."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

The prompts change based on the journaling style and the conditions the user entered earlier. 
Light mode keeps things simple with short mood or symptom questions. 
Heavy mode opens up more space for context and self-reflection. This flexibility helps 
users stay consistent by allowing them to choose what feels manageable in the moment.

After writing, the entry is saved automatically. Over time, users can 
scroll through their history and start to notice patterns that later appear in 
their generated reports.

### Reflecting on Medical Treatment with a Trusted Individual

Many users want a clear way to summarize how they have been feeling for appointments or conversations with someone close to them. RxFlect supports this by offering a simple but customizable report tool. 

From the home page, users can tap Create Report. They can choose from preset date ranges like 
Past Week or This Month, or use a custom range if they want a more specific time window. 
Once they confirm the dates, RxFlect automatically generates a default report built from 
their journal entries.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        }
    ]}
    caption={
        "The text above is outside the image block, then we have these full width images."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>
The default report includes basic trends like mood, symptoms, side effects, or medication notes. 
Users can edit the report by selecting the Edit button. This lets them choose which charts or 
insights to include so the report reflects what matters most to them.

After editing, the app shows a confirmation pop-up to save changes. 
The final report can be downloaded or shared directly through Trusted Connections on the home page.
 Users can also revisit past reports or manage who they share them with.
## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research focused on understanding how people manage their medication routines 
and how they make sense of the physical and mental changes that come with it. 
We wanted to learn what makes symptom tracking helpful, what feels overwhelming, 
and what people actually need when preparing to talk with a healthcare provider or someone close 
to them. To do that, we interviewed participants with different levels of experience, 
including people currently taking medication, people who do not take any medication, 
and a small number of healthcare workers who regularly talk with patients about symptoms and 
treatment plans. We paired these interviews with early design critiques 
and small feedback sessions to see what parts of journaling feel helpful and 
what quickly becomes overwhelming. We chose interviews because medication experiences are 
personal, and conversations helped us understand the reasons behind users' habits and frustrations. 
Talking with healthcare workers also gave us a better sense of what 
information actually helps during check-ins and what gets lost when 
people do not track how they feel. This helped us design something that 
supports clearer communication on both sides.

### Journaling Regarding Medication is Difficult

From our design research, a key insight that came up often was 
journaling about medication is difficult. Multiple participants expressed 
that they would like to journal more but are unsure what they should write 
about the effects of their medication. As they are not sure what is important 
to write, especially when they are taking multiple medications at the same time. 
This led us to wanting to focus on making journaling easier and help understand 
common symptoms that might be worth noting down. This results in Rxflect to have 
guiding questions for journaling, common symptoms for specific medical conditions, 
and medicine side effects and interactions of other medicine.

### Clear Visualization of Patient History and Reporting

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Interviews with both patients and clinicians showed how difficult it is to make sense of large 
amounts of unorganized medical information. Healthcare professionals like Cenny and Derpy 
highlighted the need for clear weekly or monthly trends, simple timelines of key events in
 a patient's medical journey, and easy visuals that help clinicians quickly understand 
 consistency or changes in a patient’s condition. Issues such as recency bias and incomplete 
 or overly vague patient recollections further reinforced the importance of accessible, 
 accurate historical context. These findings shaped the design direction toward creating 
 clear visualizations based on patient history and reporting, such as graphs, to help 
 doctors efficiently review patient histories and make more informed decisions.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Clear Summaries for Communication Between Patients and Doctors

Finally, our design research also revealed major communication gaps 
around treatment updates. Patients such as Patch and Benny tended to 
focus on only the most recent weeks when speaking with doctors, even 
with consistent journaling, leading to discussions with their doctor 
about their most recent state, not their state throughout the treatment. 
Healthcare professionals like Cenny and Derpy noted that they typically 
had to almost rely entirely on patients’ reports, and their prescription 
refill dates which may not reflect actual day-to-day behavior or feelings. 
This finding guided the design toward creating concise and cumulative summaries 
and reports to help present accurate and balanced information between patients and their doctor.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process began with many sketches to get our initial ideas 
into potential designs, with storyboards better defining our focus tasks from our 
interviews, creating user personas, and narrowing down our target audience. 
This led to us initially choosing a high level journaling health design but 
upon reflection, we realized we were trying to encapsulate all different types 
of medications and symptoms to record, even if it wasn’t specific to a patient 
and their medication. So upon further discussion and iteration, we wanted the 
journaling to be more personalized with their conditions rather than a generic 
template to capture everything. 

Once we decided on this design, we started creating paper prototypes with the 
goal of allowing people to have personalized journaling based on their medical 
condition they want to track and improve communication with trusted individuals. 
With our initial paper prototype, we conducted heuristics and usability tests with our peers. 
Through heuristic tests, we identified areas of improvements regarding navigation of our pages, 
lack of system confirmations, and consistency. Whereas the usability tests revealed more 
functionality problems with users such as users feeling restrictive with the app and 
potential of being overwhelmed depending on a user's day. Thus with these insights, 
our revisions with our paper prototype to digital mockup focused on a simpler design, 
more user control, and flexibility of core features.


### Minimalistic Design

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x800,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
    }}
    caption={
        "A good caption supports helps a reader understand what is important. " +
        "It thus supports skimming and also provides an emphasis on key points of related text."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In our design process, we wanted to ensure that our design would be minimalistic to avoid 
people being overwhelmed and can easily journal. Still, in our 
heuristic and usability testing, many people commented inconsistencies 
with home bar, icons, and layout of pages. This is in part that we had 
multiple people drawing the paper prototypes, which led to conflicting 
visuals and layouts. So going into our digital mock up, we standardized 
how we wanted our layout and visuals to look to ensure consistency is 
upheld to satisfy our minimalist design.

### Presentation of Information

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "This caption is applied to the entire block of images. " +
        "See that it spans across the area of the images."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Participants commented that a lot of screens either showed too much information at once or 
did not show enough for users to understand what was happening. 
For example, the calendar screen did not show which days the user 
actually journaled, so people were confused about what days to select 
when building a report. On the journaling side, some participants felt 
overwhelmed by long lists of prompts, while others wanted more context or simpler options.

In response to this feedback, we redesigned key screens to convey 
more or reduced information so users don’t feel overwhelmed nor get lost. 
Such as our calendar screen now has color icons to indicate different types of 
actions a user did and reducing the journaling prompts text into more slides to 
not overwhelm the user with info.


</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Flexibility of Journaling and Report Creation

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder600x300,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "These are two images stacked in a column. " +
                     "Notice that the text on the left is not broken up by the images."
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder600x300,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "These are two images stacked in a column. " +
                     "Notice that the text on the left is not broken up by the images."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

From our usability testing, we realized that the overall flow of the app felt too strict 
and did not match how people actually journal or create reports. A lot of participants 
said they felt “locked in” to a certain path. For example, the journaling screen always 
showed the same types of prompts, even if the user was not feeling that way that day. 
Some users wanted to skip questions or choose an easier option, while others wanted space 
to write more. The report creation flow also forced users through every step in a fixed order, 
which made things feel slow and repetitive.

These reactions showed us that our design needed more flexibility so people 
could choose how they want to interact with the app on different days. 
We updated the journaling flow to support different levels of detail and 
added more optional steps. We also loosened the report creation process 
so users can jump between sections without being forced into a single path.
