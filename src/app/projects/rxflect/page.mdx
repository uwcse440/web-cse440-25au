Managing medication can affect people in a lot of different ways, and it is often hard to 
keep track of how you feel from day to day. Most people want to notice patterns in their mood,
symptoms, or side effects, but daily journaling usually feels confusing or repetitive. 
A lot of the tools that already exist do not help users stay consistent, and the information 
they collect does not translate into anything useful when talking with a trusted or medical 
individual. Because of this, it becomes easy to lose track of important details about how the 
medication is actually affecting them.

RxFlect addresses this by making reflection manageable and meaningful. The app 
guides users through personalized daily check-ins with adaptable prompts and 
automatically synthesizes entries into clear, visual reports. This turns 
fragmented notes into actionable insights, empowering users to understand 
their medication journey and communicate effectively with their care team. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>



## Design Walkthrough

RxFlect is built around two core experiences that help users better understand and 
communicate about their medication journey: making daily reflection 
effortless and transforming reflections into shareable insights. 
These tasks work together to make tracking symptoms and changes feel 
easier and more meaningful and more meaningful.  

### Expressing Their Well-Being Through Guided Journaling

With users using Rxflect, it helps provide guiding questions based on a 
journaling mode and information about their medical condition and
 medication effects. As when user inputs their medical condition 
 and medication, the journaling provides specific questions to 
 different medical conditions and how much a user wants to journal. 
 This design provides structured yet flexible journaling guidance, 
 helping users determine what to record and how much to write based on their daily health.

### Reflecting on Medical Treatment with a Trusted Individual

With all the journaling a user does, we wanted a way to provide users to share the information with 
a trusted individual. Sharing information can be difficult as it’s time consuming to
review each journal entry and remember what you experienced. So to help reflect on 
your medical treatment, users can generate a report within a given time frame to aggregate
information that they had been recording within that time frame. Furthermore, before saving 
the report, the user can review and edit the report to better reflect what they have been
experiencing. This design helps a user better understand what they have been experiencing 
and provides a well informed report that they can share to discuss with trusted individuals.

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research focused on understanding how people manage their medication routines 
and how they make sense of the physical and mental changes that come with it. 
We wanted to learn what makes symptom tracking helpful, what feels overwhelming, 
and what people actually need when preparing to talk with a healthcare provider or someone close 
to them. To do that, we interviewed participants with different levels of experience, 
including people currently taking medication, people who do not take any medication, 
and a small number of healthcare workers who regularly talk with patients about symptoms and 
treatment plans. We paired these interviews with early design critiques 
and small feedback sessions to see what parts of journaling feel helpful and 
what quickly becomes overwhelming. We chose interviews because medication experiences are 
personal, and conversations helped us understand the reasons behind users' habits and frustrations. 
Talking with healthcare workers also gave us a better sense of what 
information actually helps during check-ins and what gets lost when 
people do not track how they feel. This helped us design something that 
supports clearer communication on both sides.

### Journaling Regarding Medication is Difficult

From our design research, a key insight that came up often was 
journaling about medication is difficult. Multiple participants expressed 
that they would like to journal more but are unsure what they should write 
about the effects of their medication. As they are not sure what is important 
to write, especially when they are taking multiple medications at the same time. 
This led us to wanting to focus on making journaling easier and help understand 
common symptoms that might be worth noting down. This resulted in Rxflect to have 
guiding questions for journaling, common symptoms for specific medical conditions, 
and medicine side effects and interactions of other medicine.

### Clear Visualization of Patient History and Reporting

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: design_img1,
        alt: "A paper sketch of how the report initially looked. It has 3 images, where the the first image "
        + "in the far left is an image of you selecting which journal entry one by one you done in a month." 
        + "middle image is then how the report is created after selecting the journal entries."
        +"The third image is viewing and sharing the newly created report.",
    }}
    caption={
        <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
        Initial prototype of how selecting journal entries to create and share a report.
        </div>
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"600px"}
>

Interviews with both patients and clinicians showed how difficult it is to make sense of large 
amounts of unorganized medical information. Healthcare professionals like Cenny and Derpy 
highlighted the need for clear weekly or monthly trends, simple timelines of key events in
a patient's medical journey, and easy visuals that help clinicians quickly understand 
consistency or changes in a patient’s condition. Issues such as recency bias and incomplete 
or overly vague patient recollections further reinforced the importance of accessible, 
accurate historical context. These findings shaped the design direction toward creating 
clear visualizations based on patient history and reporting, such as graphs, to help 
doctors efficiently review patient histories and make more informed decisions.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Clear Summaries for Communication Between Patients and Doctors

Finally, our design research also revealed major communication gaps 
around treatment updates. Patients such as Patch and Benny tended to 
focus on only the most recent weeks when speaking with doctors, even 
with consistent journaling, leading to discussions with their doctor 
about their most recent state, not their state throughout the treatment. 
Healthcare professionals like Cenny and Derpy noted that they typically 
had to almost rely entirely on patients’ reports, and their prescription 
refill dates which may not reflect actual day-to-day behavior or feelings. 
This finding guided the design toward creating concise and cumulative summaries 
and reports to help present accurate and balanced information between patients and their doctor.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process began with many sketches to get our initial ideas 
into potential designs, with storyboards better defining our focus tasks from our 
interviews, creating user personas, and narrowing down our target audience. 
This led to us initially choosing a high level journaling health design but 
upon reflection, we realized we were trying to encapsulate all different types 
of medications and symptoms to record, even if it wasn’t specific to a patient 
and their medication. So upon further discussion and iteration, we wanted the 
journaling to be more personalized with their conditions rather than a generic 
template to capture everything. 

Once we decided on this design, we started creating paper prototypes with the 
goal of allowing people to have personalized journaling based on their medical 
condition they want to track and improve communication with trusted individuals. 
With our initial paper prototype, we conducted heuristics and usability tests with our peers. 
Through heuristic tests, we identified areas of improvements regarding navigation of our pages, 
lack of system confirmations, and consistency. Whereas the usability tests revealed more 
functionality problems with users such as users feeling restrictive with the app and 
potential of being overwhelmed depending on a user's day. Thus with these insights, 
our revisions with our paper prototype to digital mockup focused on a simpler design, 
more user control, and flexibility of core features.


### Minimalistic Design

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: initial_preview,
            alt: "A paper calender of the month January, where user is selecting 8 days of when they journal into their report."
        },
        {
            src: revised_preview,
            alt: "A revised digital calender where now has color icons on a day to indicate different actions a user taken to help select days to put in your report. Blue being you journaled, orange being refilled prescription, and red being you experienced a symptom"
        },

    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Preview screen(left) originally wasn't clear how to exit, what it achievied, had a confusing layout and what you could select. In the revised preview(right), made it clear what you have accomplished with a straighfoward button to move on to the next task."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>

In our design process, we wanted to ensure that our design would be minimalistic to avoid 
people being overwhelmed and can easily journal. Still, in our 
heuristic and usability testing, many people commented inconsistencies 
with home bar, icons, and layout of pages. This is in part that we had 
multiple people drawing the paper prototypes, which led to conflicting 
visuals and layouts. So going into our digital mock up, we standardized 
how we wanted our layout and visuals to look to ensure consistency is 
upheld to satisfy our minimalist design.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Presentation of Information

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: intial_calender,
            alt: "A paper calender of the month January, where user is selecting 8 days of when they journal into their report."
        },
        {
            src: revised_calender,
            alt: "A revised digital calender where now has color icons on a day to indicate different actions a user taken to help select days to put in your report. Blue being you journaled, orange being refilled prescription, and red being you experienced a symptom"
        },

    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Left image was our initial calendar design to select days to report for journaling," +
        " where the right image is our revised version to help show more actions a user done."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>

Participants commented that a lot of screens either showed too much information at once or 
did not show enough for users to understand what was happening. 
For example, the calendar screen did not show which days the user 
actually journaled, so people were confused about what days they could review. On the journaling side, some participants felt 
overwhelmed by long lists of prompts, while others wanted more context or simpler options.

In response to this feedback, we redesigned key screens to convey 
more or reduced information so users don’t feel overwhelmed nor get lost. 
Such as our calendar screen now has color icons to indicate different types of 
actions a user did and reducing the journaling prompts text into more slides to 
not overwhelm the user with info.


</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Flexibility of Journaling and Report Creation


From our usability testing, we realized that the overall flow of the app felt too strict 
and did not match how people actually journal or create reports. A lot of participants 
said they felt “locked in” to a certain path. For example, the journaling screen always 
showed the same types of prompts, even if the user was not feeling that way that day. 
Some users wanted to skip questions or choose an easier option, while others wanted space 
to write more. The report creation flow also forced users through every step in a fixed order, 
which made things feel slow and repetitive.

These reactions showed us that our design needed more flexibility so people 
could choose how they want to interact with the app on different days. 
We updated the journaling flow to support different levels of detail and 
added more optional steps. We also loosened the report creation process 
so users can jump between sections without being forced into a single path.
