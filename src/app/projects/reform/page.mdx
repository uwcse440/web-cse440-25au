## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Many people fall victim to unsustainable clothing habits (e.g., impulse purchases, irregular closet maintenance), 
despite being aware of existing sustainable practices. 
We see that people tend to accumulate clothing over time as a by-product of their lifestyle and environment. 

There is a clear need for a convenient and accessible tool that would help bridge the gap between simply 
consuming and taking action in a way that reinforces sustainable habits. 
Current common habits include donations and hand-me-downs, but other options are often hard to come by and 
organize for, especially beyond close personal circles.

</ProjectImageBlock>

Our app aims to go beyond building a digital closet by incorporating outfit tracking habits and building 
community through shared senses of style to build sustainability in practices people already engage in naturally.
Track, RE:FORM, Style: an article swap platform for users to sustainably explore styles and clothing. 
The platform enables users to curate their personal style and see what they wear most, create a digital closet 
with outfit checks, and build a community through local clothing swap events, removing the stress of expenses 
from fashion while staying sustainable! 

## Design Walkthrough

Our design aims to help users track and explore different ways of styling clothing items, while also 
encouraging them to engage and trade with people around the area who share a similar sense of style. 
By centering this process on a mobile application, individuals can conveniently log and track their outfits 
while also connecting with others who share the goals of building style and sustainability.


### Building Personal Style Through Outfit Management 

When users start building their digital closet, their outfits can be uploaded through (out)fit checks, 
which can be uploaded to a clothing inventory or to a social feed. Users have the option to add tags to 
individual pieces, which allows for convenient organization and categorization. They can also add individual 
items to their digital closet along with items extracted from their (out)fit checks.

        {
            src: personalstyle,

    ]}
    caption={
        "Users can keep track of fits (whether they choose to share or not to their friends), as well as label articles with tags."
    }
    width={12}

        "Users can edit the availability of their clothes for others to see."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"800px"}
>

</ProjectImagesBlock>


### Explore Social Clothing Events

As users start to build their digital closets, they can also explore community clothing swapping events 
around the area. Events are organized by various factors, including location, style/occasion, and mutual 
degrees of connection. Users can create and attend various clothing events, meet users with similar styles, 
and explore and preview items in others’ closets. 

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: eventwalk,

## Design Research and Key Insights

We focused our design research to learn more about how people have developed their personal relationship 
with sustainability and their closets over time. Our research aimed to understand the various sustainable 
habits people already have with their clothes, as well as the barriers they commonly run into (costs, knowledge, etc). 
Ultimately, we wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the motivations and barriers that influence how people 
incorporate sustainability into their clothing habits. 


Our design research was conducted through a series of 1:1 interviews with individuals from similar 
socio-economic backgrounds, but varying experiences with sustainability and style. We decided this was the best 
research method since we were able to create personalized and reflective conversations with our participants 
to more learn about how their environment and communities shape their relationship with their clothes. 


### Communities and Socialization Affect Style and Sustainability
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: community,
            alt: "Comic showing how someone struggling to clean out their closet.",
            caption: "Shared experiences and fulfillment results in better retainment and satisfaction.",
        }
    ]}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

 Our primary goal was to promote sustainability, and identifying this important factor created a pathway 
 toward that goal. Communities influence behaviors; as one participant said, “I’m inspired by people around 
 me and surrounded by people who care [about sustainability].” This impacts both personal style and sustainable
  habits, so we wanted our platform to emphasize both facets. Multiple participants mentioned they explore 
  styles and outfits through social media, such as Pinterest and TikTok. This, in combination with our 
  knowledge of how community influences sustainability, motivated us to structure our platform similar to 
  social media. One participant also mentioned holding “mini thrift trades” with friends, which served as 
  inspiration for the clothing swap events to bring people together beyond their own circles.

### Avoiding Shopping Barriers

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: stylewalkthru,
            alt: "Comic showing how the app facilitates a user in exploring their style.",
            caption: "Without the additional processes of shopping, people are more inclined to practice sustainably while feeling fulfilled!",
        }
    ]}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

One of the main barriers to sustainable shopping is the lack of affordable options. Ethical labor and natural 
materials often reflect the cost of new clothing, which can deter people despite being aware of sustainable 
fashion. Fast fashion, on the other hand, is cheap and convenient, and multiple participants reported buying 
from fast fashion even though they want to be sustainable and ethical. To create an alternative that stays 
one level cheaper than fast fashion, we deliberately omitted a price tag to convey the intention of all items 
being free. This moves our platform away from shopping and encourages users to form sustainable habits with 
existing clothes. For convenience, we created a messaging and communication system. The original idea was a 
mass group chat for clothing swap events, but eventually pivoted to private messages about specific clothing 
articles for better organization and management.


</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Low-Effort Usage Maintains Engagement
Another main barrier that we found was that most users don’t have the time nor energy to be manually 
uploading pieces of their closet and accessories with each new update. While there are many apps already out 
there that support digital closet functionality, most people do not use them because of how much manual setup 
and updating they require. In order to create something that people would actually use, it would need to be 
easily accessible with minimal menial work from the user themselves. Thus, we tackled this problem by 
implementing the use of artificial intelligence, in which a person’s uploaded photos (whether that be through 
fit checks, close up of articles, or even mundane photos in their camera roll) are analyzed to derive what 
items a user has in their closet. The app will automatically upload their findings into the user’s digital 
closet, requiring the user to do nothing more than a quick set up configuration and continued interaction with 
the community through fit checks (if they choose to do so, but not required). 

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process focused on creating a platform that felt intuitive and convenient to navigate, 
while also ensuring users felt confident in their ability to manage and connect their information with others. 
In the early stages of paper prototyping, we initially had a rough idea of how we envisioned user profiles and
 event pages would look. Through inspection and usability testing, we were able to fine-tune specific aspects 
 of this design to improve app navigation and user control, especially while moving between different screens. 
 In our digital mockup, we were then able to bring these improvements together by introducing more consistency 
 through cohesive design choices.


### Confirmation Interrupting Workflow

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: notifs,
            alt: "Original paper notification design on the left, new digital notification design on the right.",
            caption: "This shows the before and after of us applying the changes to the pop up notifications.",
        }
    ]}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

 In early versions of the paper prototype, there was a heavy usage of small pop-ups that were used to 
 confirm the actions made by the user, such as having created or saved a swap event, were successful. 
 Through testing, we were able to identify a common issue that came up from the testers, where we observed 
 that most of them would have some hesitation or confusion when interacting with the indicators/pop-ups. 
 Based on this, we decided to change them to be temporary pop-ups in empty spaces on the screen that were 
 unused, so they wouldn't block user interactions and could be manually dismissed by a clear ‘X’ on the corner 
 of the pop-up. This redesign reduced confusion, respected the flow between the user and the design. 
 And allowed the users to continue to use the app with full confidence when it comes to receiving confirmation 
 notifications of their actions, overall resulting in the experience being a lot smoother 
 and intuitive for users.

### Ambiguity of Article Status 
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: availability,
            alt: "Original paper availability indicator on the left, new digital availability indicator on the right.",
            caption: "This shows the before and after of us applying the visual changes to indicate the availability of an item.",
        }
    ]}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
We received feedback that our initial indicator of item availability (a green lock) was too vague and/or was 
missing explanation/context that specified its purpose in our design. We also had confusion on whether our 
original lock design indicated an item being available, unavailable, or in need of selection. Based on this 
feedback, we chose to revise our design to a green dot and to add more states to the screen to indicate 
selection; however, after our usability testings, we received more insight on how users were still unclear 
about the green icon as well as system status. 
After our heuristic evaluations and usability testing, we understood the need to change the icon to a 
universally understandable icon (i.e. price tag) to convey availability while also adding clear confirmation
 messages and instructions on how to edit an item’s availability.
</ProjectImagesBlock>



### Consistency During Navigation
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: navigation,
            alt: "Original paper navigation on the left, new digital navigation bar on the right.",
            caption: "This shows the before and after of us applying a navigation bar in response to inconsistencies.",
        }
    ]}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
The navigation bar was something we had discussed near the end of our paper prototype. Initially, we just 
placed back/home buttons wherever we saw fit or when we thought navigation was needed - this was fine for a
 few screens but eventually it became disorganized, inconsistent, and occasionally even missing. This would 
 often trap our usability testers in certain pages or cause confusion due to the inconsistent placing of back 
 buttons and icons. We decided to switch to a standard navigation bar at the bottom of the screen so users 
 would have an easier time navigating, while still having the capability to go back just one screen. This also 
 allowed us to simplify navigation to events and to create posts, creating a centralized area for all main 
 functions.
