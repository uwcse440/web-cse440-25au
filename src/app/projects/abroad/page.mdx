## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Traveling alone to a foreign country for an extended period is difficult. Study abroad 
students from across America often enter these experiences with no connections and 
little knowledge of how to enrich their time outside of academics. While there are many 
travel and student apps for organization, language learning, cultural education, and 
transportation, none connect them with one of the most helpful data sources there is: 
past travelers.

Abroad is an event-finding social app that uses this data to enrich the study-abroad 
experience. With so many students traveling abroad every year but little communication 
or transfer of knowledge between them, a hub that connects current study-abroad students 
with reviews and reflections from the past helps them better inform themselves before 
visiting destinations or attending events. Abroad allows any user to create events or 
discover others. From there, students can learn from past related events in the same 
location, meet other attendees in person, and create more informed discoveries for themselves.

## Design Walkthrough

After identifying relevant data sources (primarily, other current and past study-abroad students and travelers)
we turned our focus towards providing useability in areas that mattered most to our target audience: improving 
their experience by making connections with others and discovering more niche local events. These tasks were easy
in some ways in terms of essential design, but difficult to implement specifics on. Social connections could be established
through the same system as standard social media apps, but this might destroy what makes study-abroad special; similarly,
we could just display maps of 'hot spot' local events (this was actually a heavily considered initial design), but this
might remove the 'tangible and niche advice' element we aim to achieve by leveraging past travelers as a data source. 

### Finding local events

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageEvents1,
            alt: "Opening screen",
        },
        {
            src: imageEvents2,
            alt: "Events near me",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "The initial screen can direct users to discover events near them. " +
        "Users can additionally make thier own events for others to join."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

The core feature of the app revolves around 'events'. Any user can make an event, or discover
other users' events. These are filtered by location, price to attend, date, number of people going,
and how many 'friends' you have going. This makes it so that users can find events conducive to their
school schedule and location, and can either opt to go to events with people they haven't met yet on
the app, or go with friends. Importantly, by accessing the event details, users can see what others
in the past have commented / reflected on about previous events in similar locations. For example,
if user Ava is organizing a visit at a cafe near the Eiffel Tower, others who have visited will have
their experiences show up in the event details: for instance, the app finds James' old comment about
how 5:30 is the perfect time to go in fall, which may help Ava and her event attendees to refine their
event. These recommendations / past reviews are organized by exact proximity (ones that are closest appear
first), or when enough have been looked over, the number of upvotes they have. 'Events' can range from
generic things like visiting the Eiffel Tower, to more small / niche meetups at little known cafes, all
the way to day-long or one-time events that are planned in advance. Tags relating to these ("meetup", 
"landmark", "festival" may be a couple, for example) can also be established in making events and filtered
by users searching for more events.

## Design Research and Key Insights

Abroad started off as more of a personal tracking app: users could personally review places
they've visited and get new recommendations based on some intelligent data source and location.
"Some intelligent data source" left a lot of thinking to be done-- eventually, on further iteration
and determining what that magic data source might be, we discovered that the greatest and most
untapped data source of all was other fellow travelers, past and present. This was largely informed
through targeted research: interviews with students who had gone abroad themselves. 

We conducted interviews lasting roughly 30 minutes, our interviews included 9 questions covering motivations, 
planning logistics, app usage, preparedness, daily routines, trusted resources, memorable experiences, 
and product preferences. These questions were structured to figure out emerging themes and for flexible 
follow-up questions. Our participants were students that recently returned from studying abroad. 
Each participant went to different locations for varying amounts of time ranging from 3 weeks to 3 months. 
These participants captured diverse experiences and this allowed us to identify patterns.

Student 1: Studied abroad in Granada, Spain for 3 months. They highlighted their positive memories in cultural
immersion via local festivals and random discoveries, noting that they only found these through meeting other
study abroad students in their building.

Student 2: Participated in two short-term study abroad programs, one to Tuscany, Italy and another to Jamaica.
They noted the monumental difference between locations, being grateful for family friends who lived near Tuscany
and wishing they had a similar human point of contact to guide them in Jamaica.

Student 3: Studied 3 months in Japan. This participant struggled to manage a detailed itinerary of what they
wanted to do and where to go on top of school. They wished they had an easier time managing this through other
connections in the area rather than attempting to take it all on alone.

### Social connections were more valuable than convenience or time-management

While there were minor gropes about convenience in employing public transport, getting over the 
language barrier, or working around a student schedule, there was one big common theme among all
three inteviews we conducted: Their most memmorable experiences (and what they felt they missed
out on more of) revolved around connections with others and local events. Whether time management
became more difficult without being able to rely on anyone else to plan (student 3), or nearly all
positive moments of discovery coming from the recommendations of others (student 1), people were always
the common denominator in terms of making or breaking a study-abroad experience. This opened the design
task: how can we conveniently connect study-abroad students and allow them to rely on eachothers' knowledge-bases?

### Travelers of the past are a massive data source

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageFestival,
            alt: "Locals enjoying a festival scene",
            caption: "Interviewees highlighted memorable experiences from spontaneous, free, local events",
        },
        {
            src: imageFrustration,
            alt: "Confused woman looks at computer info",
            caption: "Disingenuous or overly general traveling knowledge online only leads to frustration or unmemorable experiences; human connection was far preferred",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In our search for a 'magic data source' to solve of our recommendation-based design problems, interviews
became extremely helpful and highlighted one we had not thought of before: travelers of the past. Student 1
was lucky enough to have had extended family who had been in the area before and give some guidance on places
to visit and nuances that wouldn't be made clear on online apps or guides. Student 2 had two very short abroad
experiences, and wished that they had an actual person to help guide them and offer insight rather than the often
overly-general online advice.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Cultural immersion through spontaneous local events was more enriching than major attractions

Student 1 heavily praised free nearby events, and remembered these much more than the biggest and most famous ones
recommended by online guides. Student 2 came into their experience heavily prepared, brining many luxury items. Throughout
their stay they discovered that 'unpredictability' and unseen cultural differences bred the best stories and adventures
more than the comforts of home. Student 3 highlighted that spontaneous experiences (especially social ones) led to the
best memories and even long lasting connections with people they didn't know beforehand. While insight didn't directly
inform one singular task, it heavily relates and helped to inform some of our initial designs and our two final tasks: 
making connections and discovering local social events.
