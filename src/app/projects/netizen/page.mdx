## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Online friendships are often categorized as being sporadic, short-lived, and easy to lose track of. 
Many times a friendship online can be lost solely because someone stops playing a game, or they change their username and profile, 
or simply because people just drift apart due to extensive periods of no communication. Current solutions to problems like this are 
sometimes effective — such as Discord’s notepad feature, Instagram’s close friends list, Steam’s ability to invite people to play games 
together, etc. — but suffer from the exceptional amount of work required to interface with in a meaningful way. 

Finding a solution that is easy to use, and safe, could help to maintain and create new long lasting connections between people. 
We think that anything that helps to foster community is a generally good thing! Not only that, but losing connections with people 
can be isolating and damaging, so finding a way to help to prevent that happening (when the friendship is safe and wanted by both parties), is exceptionally important.

## Design Walkthrough

Netizen is a tool to help you thrive in an online setting! To accomplish this, Netizen has two main goals: help you recognize and reach
out to friends online, and to help strengthen those friendships. Netizen integrates your accounts on any major gaming platform 
(Steam, GOG, PlayStation, etc.) and can be taken on the go to keep you connected to your online friends in whatever setting you prefer.
Netizens track data about you and your online friends like old username and profile pictures, match history,
social medias, friends that you have in common with others, and lots more in the hopes of being able to make your online friendships last.

### Strengthen an Online Friendship

        {
            src: imageTask1,
            alt: "Main screen on the Netizen display. Showcases the user's friends list",
        },
        {
            src: imageTask3,
            alt: "Netizen scren that allows the user to adjust their frienship tier and make changes to what information is shared.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    caption={
        "From the home screen, you can open a friend’s profile, review your shared history, and decide what " +
        "details you want to exchange to rebuild the connection."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

When users first open Netizen, they need to set it up and connect with some of their friends 
through this new system. After users turn the system on, it gives you a title screen, then an 
introduction to help them set up and get acquainted with the system. Once set up, the friends 
from other accounts auto-populate onto home screen. If users want to connect with their friends,
by clicking on their profile, users can check some basic statistics of their friends such as Play Time, 
Favorite Game, Highlighted Memories, etc... Users can also click on “Manage Friendship” button to go to 
the manage friendship screen, and they can do functions like make a new friend, and set all of the information 
they want to share with them based on the closeness level of tehy and their friends.

### Recognize and Reach Out to a Friend Online

While playing a game, Netizen notifies users when their friends 
are in the lobby with them as well as when the last time they played together may be. Even if 
a user does not recognize this person, they can investigate. Clicking on a friend's profile, 
gives access to their profile changes, including old usernames or profile pictures. It also gives 
access to shared game history and memories made together online. Once a user recognizes their friend,
they can find all of their connected accounts, which allows a user to pull up a QR code that
can be used to reach out to their online friend!

## Design Research and Key Insights

We started our design research by investigating the challenges people face maintaining online friendships and
how people want those relationships to evolve, if at all. We conducted interviews with several participants with
varying levels of online activity. We chose these participants to get a better idea of how people use online spaces
in different contexts. These interviews are conversational under relaxed enviroment to help user express their 
thoughts freely and easily follow the question scripts. With this approach, it eases interviewees pressure and 
encourage them to say their opinions and share information with us.

Cam: a 20-year-old who monitors his socials online and primarily interacts with people he knows in real life
via Discord and Instagram.

Banana: a 21-year-old who considers themself a gamer. Their online interaction mainly happens on Discord and in online games.

Basil: a 22-year-old drag artist who has a small social media following. They use social media to connect with other artists 
and friends in their community and around the world.

All of our interviews were conducted over Zoom or Discord calls for the convenience of the participants. During these calls, 
we had each of the participants share stories from their online experiences to better understand how to improve the process 
of forming and maintaining online friendships.

### For people who make friends online, it’s difficult to keep track of and stay connected with the people they meet.

Talking about maintain connection with online friends, almost everyone has the same experience of lose connections.
One most important thing we noticed is people usually make a lot of friends then forget they are. The reasons
are similar such as changing icon, name, and profiles. Since all of interviewees are either have a deep experience
in online games, or have a lot of online friend, we believe their insight are sharp and crucial. Therefore,
we conclude that people mostly remember them based on their profiles.

Banana described how they have played games with hundreds of different people that, and how they are constantly forgetting 
people who are on their friends list. 
Basil: "no idea" where some of their online friends came from. Especially after some time passes, they're just another 
username in their friends list."
Cam: "How did I meet this person? For them, this usually doesn't matter that much in conversation, but it's just a thought 
that bugs me in the back of my head.”

### Online and in-person friendships occupy different parts of participants’ lives and satisfy different social needs.

            src: imageResearchDesign1,

            caption: "Overview sketch from original sketching that showcased a friends profile, the information shown, and an early version of the QR code system to access other connected accounts.",

            caption: "The mutual friendship is connected with amount of information that people share with each other",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Another thing we noticed is even though our interviewees enjoy the time with online friends, they still want
to keep some distances from them. When we ask that are they willing to let their online friends being
in-person friends, the answers are not firm yes. Instead, they mention that they just want online friends to 
stay online, and sometimes they accecpt online friend to leave. These insights bring us with hints that the
position and trust level of online friends is different and special, thus maintaining a comfortable distance
between them may let the friendship even deeper.
Basil has “a few online friendships" that they "would not want to translate in person.” 
"online and in-person friendships occupy a slightly different niche"
“okay with it staying that way.”
"They are sort of person to be happy seeing people come and go.” 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Friendships that develop online are difficult to maintain because of artificial pressure created by existing platforms.


Lastly, we talked about the current platform they are using and we get a couple of popular names, Instagrams,
Discord, and Steam Friend. However, even we assume they are all social platform with similar functions, 
interviewees gave us different feedbacks that they are also different.

Basil says that, especially on platforms like Instagram, there’s more of a “content creator 
and content consumer” relationship than “people interacting online.” While this can be easier 
on other platforms like Discord, this implies that the people will like you based on how “good” 
the content you share is, rather than on your personality. 
Cam says, “a common problem with texting is you don't get tone across,” and, ”how you communicate 
... is the biggest concern for online friendships.” Because it’s harder to express yourself in 
a way that others will understand, people have to find workarounds to properly maintain their 
online friendships.


## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Once settled on a concept, we went through a long process of iterative design. We started with a physical paper
prototype that was crafted in order to get a base idea of what our project would actually look like. However, through
a process of usability and heuristic testing we realized that a lot of our initial design was confusing, or 
did not function in the way that we wanted it to. Our core mindset was ease of use, and clarity of message, which guided
our entire iterative process.

### Helping users understand how to use Netizen!

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageDocumentation,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
    }}
    caption={
        "The documentation helps users to know the basic functions of Netizen and shows how to use Netizen"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

One theme that surfaced over the course of both heuristic evaluation and usability testing 
was understanding the purpose of Netizen and its features. Participants commented that the 
setup page and the multiple available options were unclear, so they were likely to just blow 
past it. From the main screen of Netizen, they found it difficult to navigate because they didn’t 
know what it was able to do. They also found some of our word choices, such as “Profile History” 
and “Memories,” to be confusing. With all of this feedback that Netizen was hard to understand, 
we realized that it was difficult for users to build an effective mental model when using Netizen, 
and we therefore needed to provide extra documentation from within the design. So, we made setting 
up Netizen more modular and provided clearer explanations. Then, we added a button leading to a 
“How-To” screen so that they could get that information in an unobtrusive way. Lastly, we added 
extra pop-ups that would give explanations and ensure that they didn’t have to remember the meaning 
of that terminology in the context of Netizen.

### UI Clarity and Readability

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageProfilePrototype,
            alt: "The previous handwritten design of profile page of Netizen, showing profile name, icon, button of Profile Changes, button of Manage Friendship, favorite games, highlighted memories with a list of vedio memories, button og Game History, and button of connected accounts",
        },
        {
            src: imageFriendProfile,
            alt: "The new digital design of profile page of Netizen, showing profile name, icon, button of Profile Changes, button of Manage Friendship, favorite games, highlighted memories with a list of vedio memories, button og Game History, and button of connected accounts",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Iterated from unclear handwritten profile design to digital profile design with a better UI" +
        "Improved to clearer layout to help users understand the functions"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Another theme that came up in testing was that the UI felt cluttered, and at times, inconsistent. 
Participants mentioned that it felt strange to have the exit buttons of pop-ups in the top left, 
but “cancel” buttons in the bottom right. Some of the screens were too cluttered, particularly 
the profile screen, which made it difficult to parse all of the information available quickly. 
This was especially problematic if you wanted to read information quickly while simultaneously 
playing a game. It also made it more difficult and overwhelming to figure out which voice commands 
were usable at a quick glance. Lastly, participants noted that some of our buttons were checkboxes 
when they should have been radio buttons, giving a false impression of how many options were allowed 
to be selected. This feedback made us go back through our design and make sure that each of our 
screens/pop-ups were consistent with each other and accurately portrayed their purpose. With the 
updated UI, we ultimately felt that the voice controls were not as necessary. We’re leaving them in 
as a helpful, optional feature, but they are no longer a core part of the design.

### Access to Users’ Information

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageMutualFriendshipinit,
            alt: "Original sketch of a 'mutual friendship' concept.",
            caption: "Early concept that showed a mutual-path system where users defined how" 
            + "close they felt to someone, and the final level was only set when both users agreed.",
        },
        {
            src: imageChangeFriendsStatus,
            alt: "Netizen page that shows Default Infomation Sharing Settings page, where users can modify their defualt sharing settings.",
            caption: "Page of default Information Sharing Settings" +
                     " allows users choose their own preferences of the data they want to share with friends in different Tiers"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

Since Netizen's design focuses on information sharing, we received a lot of feedback on how we 
decided to display personal information. First, participants found the Tier system confusing and 
restrictive since the original version didn’t allow for many customization options. We decided make 
the friendship levels into a form of presets, where the user could specify what information they want 
their Acquaintances, New Friends, Known Friends, and Trusted Friends to have access to. We decided 
that people should only have access to a piece of information if both they and their friend decide 
to share it with each other, so we also decided to add a “custom” tier option. This gives users better 
control over how much the people they meet online knows about them and helps to support a mutual flow 
of information. We were also told that the “memories” feature felt under-integrated, as they were only 
accessible on a friend’s profile page. To address this, we decided to connect memories to their own 
screen so that you have a place to view all of your memories, regardless of who they’re with. The 
usability tests and feedback we received helped inform us which contexts people want to see and share 
information about themselves and their online friendships in.
