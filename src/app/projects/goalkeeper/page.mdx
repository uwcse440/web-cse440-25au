It is often difficult for people to reduce their alcohol use, even when they genuinely want
to cut back, because drinking can become habitual and socially reinforced. Existing tools
for managing consumption are often too tedious or backfire by creating guilt-driven cycles
of motivation and relapse. Additionally, people are not interested in manual tracking that
involves high effort, but are more interested in support that helps them stay connected to
their long-term goals.

Our design, **GoalKeeper**, is a customizable Koozie for folks who continue drinking after college.
This offers a convenient way for users to automatically track their drinking, create goals,
and manage habits with friends through a companion social app. You can work together with
friends to reflect on and share progress while staying motivated. The main purpose of the
Koozie is to encourage mindful drinking in conjunction with a sustained connection to personal
and social goals.

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Design Walkthrough

Since Koozies are already popular in drinking contexts and offer a convenient way for users to track their
drinking goals, we utilized them as a medium for our design, as they also avoid the issues associated with
current tracking methods (e.g., high-effort manual tracking and invasive design).

Furthermore, we focused on celebratory design in drinking contexts: we developed its companion App so that
people can work together with friends to reflect on and share their progress in a motivating way; based on
our findings, we realized that many people rely on those around them to keep them accountable for their
drinking habits, and celebratory design in drinking contexts could be useful.

Specifically, the main purpose of the Koozie is not to serve as a perfect drink counter that fully stops
the user from drinking, but rather to encourage mindful drinking and sustained connection to personal and
social goals in an easy and passive way by simply placing drinks into the Koozie.

One of our tasks is to set, track, and manage drinking goals. Each person has their own set of goals that
they want to achieve, and thus, our app serves as a space to reflect on and manage these goals. Meanwhile,
our design supports the user by connecting them with their friends and sharing drinking goals and live
drinking activities, emphasizing that it is not an isolating journey. The second task is to encourage
self-reflection and celebration of drinking milestones, allowing users to commemorate moments when they
achieved their drinking goals by inviting them to post on the Celebration board to reflect on their
individual and/or shared goals with friends.


### Set, Track, and Manage Drinking Goals with Friends

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: set_goals,
            alt: "Users can set their drinking goals on the App by choosing duration, limit and period.",
        },
        {
            src: use_during_drinking,
            alt: "Users can use their koozie during an drinking event.",
        },
        {
            src: visual_cues,
            alt: "Koozie acts like an visual cue.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption="After specifying the goal in App, user can use the koozie during drinking sessions once connected via Bluetooth."
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

First, users could specify a goal in-app on how much they plan to drink during a given time period.
During a drinking event, users wrap their GoalKeeper koozies around their cup(s), which detects the
weight of the cup/drink and tracks the number of drinks using a dial the user initially sets. Then
the koozie sends the drink information to the user’s phone via Bluetooth. The koozie serves as a
visual reminder of a user’s goal as they actively drink, reminding them that they’ve made commitments
and want to continue using it to track their consumption.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: drinking_progress,
        alt: "Users can track their drinking progress and communicate with friends on companion App.",
    }}
    caption="Users can track their drinking progress and communicate with friends on companion App."
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

After an event, the app stores the koozie drink info and creates a report on the “Progress” page.
When the user clicks the Progress button, they can view their drinking habits over time, indicated
by different colors (red means they’ve exceeded the limit while green means they are still under the
limit), and receive a notification push. Furthermore, they can see their friends’ drinking and goals
over time if they decide to share. Friends who are under or over their limits are also indicated by
color, and people can click the “message” button on the UI to open their preferred Messaging App to
send messages to their friends. This allows friends to monitor in real-time, and they can then act
accordingly to meet the needs of the friend. After the goal time is over, the user can update their
goal for next time in the Set a Goal page.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Encourage Self-Reflection and Intentional Drinking

After the tracking period set by the user, the app analyzes the progress data and sends notifications
with tailored motivational prompts to the user, indicating whether they’ve achieved the goal or not.
It also encourages them to interact with the app’s Celebration Board to post their highlights after
completing the goal. Users can reward their personal efforts by posting these achievements and looking
back on past snapshots, which helps them stay motivated & plan for their next periods of time.
Everything is kept private to the user, but they can also choose to share their achievements with friends.
This allows the user to reinforce their commitment through social encouragement, reducing their usage.

        {
            src: celebration_board,

        }
    ]}
    caption={
        "The app prompts user notifications on goal completion and encourage them to use celebration board."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}

## Design Research and Key Insights

    The research process happened in a more casual manner, since some of our friends fell
    within our target audience. We got plenty of bad examples of how to track information
    from the interviewees. We did not get enough about different methods people think are
    good ways to track data. 

### Passive Drink Tracking

    We found that people prefer tracking methods that require very low effort from the user.
    In particular, many noted that as you get more intoxicated, it will be increasingly
    difficult to remember to track. This effect will be particularly problematic if tracking
    requires high effort. The main implication of this for our design was that efficiency of
    tracking is far more important that accuracy, an important perspective that eliminated
    many potential design options.

### Socially Motivated Tracking


<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>


    We found people are much more likely to track and be aware of their drinking habits when there
    is social connection involved. In our design research participants frequently mentioned real 
    life accountability with partners and friends as something they already used to manage habits,
    and the ability to see friends usage was a very popular concept. For our design, this implied
    that we should build in a core social element to help users achieve their goals. This manifested
    in our design as the friends system and celebration board.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Tracking Exact Numbers Can Be Harmful
    A very important finding in our design was that seeing too many precise statistics can be more
    demotivating than it is helpful. Participants in our research noted that they often find
    themselves in cycles of motivation and then depression when they feel like they have failed
    to meet their goals. They said this was further emphasized by having these failure moments
    highlighted by precise tracking. In our design, we addressed this issue by intentionally 
    avoiding any type of feature that could cause this negative feeling associated with failure, 
    and attempted to instead build something that would highlight successes to keep users motivated
    to continue to work towards their goals.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

    The social aspect of this design is interesting and could be something to work on later,
    as social pressure can have a high impact on future choices that are related to drinking.
    We believe an app is a suitable form for this social aspect, which can be combined with
    other forms of tracking to create a more comprehensive design. In our design research,
    we found that many people are heavily disincentivized by tracking that requires too much
    effort, and the critique we received also reinforced this. For this reason, we have
    intentionally chosen not to further explore designs that rely heavily on manual tracking.
    We learned that an app that helps visualize tracking data and integrates the social aspect
    is a good idea, but we need to improve the method of actually performing this tracking.


### Insights from Heuristic Evaluation


<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x800,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
    }}
    caption={
        "A good caption supports helps a reader understand what is important. " +
        "It thus supports skimming and also provides an emphasis on key points of related text."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>


    The first heuristic that the evaluation showed we were failing to successfully meet was
    **Visibility of System Status**. The heuristic evaluation revealed a lot of confusion with
    how tracking with the koozie actually worked, with evaluators frequently bringing up concerns
    with what is considered “one drink”, partial drinks, and lack of feedback on user consumption
    in the moment. Also, the evaluators mentioned a lot of difficulty in understanding the
    functionality of the statistics page. The second heuristic that the evaluation showed we were
    failing to meet was Help and Documentation. Our prototype initially had essentially no
    documentation to teach users how to use the design. This issue was also brought up with
    evaluators mentioning that the rewards feature was very vague, and the goals feature
    was difficult to fully understand without additional guidance. This issue can be partially
    solved by addressing the first heuristic problem, by making the design more intuitive.
    However, we also will add some level of tutorial/documentation to make it as easy as
    possible for the users to use our design.

### Insights from Usability Testing

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "This caption is applied to the entire block of images. " +
        "See that it spans across the area of the images."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

    We found 3 friends after a game night who were willing to be a part of our usability tests.
    We provided each of the participants with some overall context “This koozie and app is to
    be used by individuals who are trying to cut back on their alcohol consumption and hold
    themselves accountable with friends” One of our team members acted as the computer,
    moving around the paper pieces as if the tester was interacting directly with our app.
    Another, acted as the observer by taking notes on the process. We made some changes from
    session 1 to session 2 to prompt the user more for their thoughts as they were interacting
    with the app. We also led with the app first instead of starting with the Koozie interaction
    so that the user could gather more context. Some of the main issues that surfaced from our
    usability testing included confusion on interpreting graphs on the progress page, how to
    use all the elements of the koozie, how to delete posts in the celebration board and
    creating impossible goals on accident. During the usability testing, all participants
    commented that the koozie seemed somewhat redundant for individuals going to parties
    and switching cups/cans/glasses a lot. The second major flaw we found is the bar graph
    for alcohol consumption was unclear to the user and the participants wished to have a
    clearer way for representing the alcohol consumption and the limit for them. We decided
    to use a bar graph instead to represent their consumption. Furthermore, based on that
    feedback, we decided to use different colors in these graph and interactions to inform
    the user about their goals (“red” is exceeding consumption while “green” is within the
    limits).

### Tutorialization and Ease of Use

    We learned through feedback on our design that physical rewards (gift cards, etc.) had a
    lot of problems associated with them as a concept. We concluded that these physical rewards
    would provide the wrong incentive for users to work towards their goal, and they also incentivize
    cheating the system. We still wanted some type of reward system, to give users a sense of
    accomplishment and pride when they achieved their goal. Instead of having a physical reward
    system for the digital mockup, we changed to a “celebration board”, where users can create
    their own achievements that they can look back on and share with their friends. This new
    concept merges together the social and goal setting aspects of our design in a convenient and
    engaging manner.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: board_help,
            alt: "Help on the celebration board page.",
        },
        {
            src: friends_help,
            alt: "Help on the friends page.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={6}
    caption="Extra information on the Help Page"
>

    During our usability testing, we found that some people experience confusion when using our prototype.
    The prototype had no guidance on how to get started or how to connect the koozie, which makes it
    difficult for first-time users. So, we added an introduction on how to use the koozie to address this.
    In the digital mockup, the app opens with an introduction screen, followed by a simple walkthrough that
    explains how to pair the koozie to the app and how to use the koozie for the most accurate tracking,
    making users feel more confident and supported from the start. Help buttons have also been added
    across multiple screens to offer ongoing guidance and prevent users from feeling lost.
