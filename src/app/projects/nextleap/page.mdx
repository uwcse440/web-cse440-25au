Many dancers, athletes, and performers struggle to develop skills on their own because they lack the structured guidance, real-time feedback, and emotional support they typically get in a studio. Without clear cues about alignment, readiness, or progress, practicing new tricks often feels confusing or risky. This can lead to frustration, inconsistent improvement, and hesitation to try harder skills, especially for users with different bodies, confidence levels, or learning needs.

To address these gaps, we designed Next Leap, a smart mirror that blends familiar studio habits with intelligent, personalized support. Because dancers naturally rely on mirrors, this surface becomes an ideal place to layer tutorials, recorded practice sessions, and adaptive feedback. The mirror helps users learn new skills, understand their progress, and receive the kind of feedback is personalized, while also supporting the emotional side of practice through encouraging reminders.

By integrating real-time guidance with positive reinforcement, Next Leap bridges the gap between self-practice and studio instruction helping dancers build confidence, resilience, and mastery through reflective feedback-driven learning.

## Design Walkthrough

We focused on two important focus tasks to design our solution on which includes "improving movement and form based on personalized feedback" and "staying motivated and overcoming mental blocks". The first focus task, improving movement and form based on personalized feedback, addresses a core challenge dancers face when practicing alone: the inability to recognize alignment errors, understand readiness, or track progress in real time. Without structured guidance, skill development becomes guesswork, increasing the risk of injury and slowing improvement. Personalized feedback helps users self-correct with precision, build safer technique, and gain clarity on how their body is moving, all of which are essential for progressing confidently outside a studio environment.

The second focus task, staying motivated and overcoming mental blocks, supports the emotional side of learning that often goes unnoticed in current tools. Independent practice can feel discouraging, especially when progress feels slow or users doubt their ability to improve. Motivational prompts, small wins, and reflection tools help sustain confidence and persistence during challenging moments. By reinforcing effort, celebrating improvements, and offering emotional support, this task ensures users remain engaged and resilient as they continue developing their skills over time.


### Improve Movement and Form Based on Personalized Feedback

            src: two,

        },
        {
            src: three,

Improving movement and form based on personalized feedback is essential for helping dancers understand their technique without relying on an in-person instructor. The system guides users through selecting a dance style, skill category, and specific movement they want to learn, ensuring they enter practice with clarity and structure. Once they begin, the mirror provides a step-by-step tutorial that demonstrates correct technique, allowing dancers to see an ideal version of the movement before attempting it themselves. Our design supports dancers of all levels by breaking down complex skills into manageable parts and establishing a clear reference for what proper form looks like.

As the user practices, the system records their attempt and plays it back with real-time, personalized annotations that highlight areas needing adjustment. Visual cues such as alignment markers, posture reminders, and form corrections help dancers understand exactly what to change and why it matters. This immediate, targeted feedback reduces uncertainty, prevents the reinforcement of incorrect habits, and promotes safer skill development. By combining guided instruction with feedback, the experience helps users build precision, confidence, and body awareness which are key elements for effective independent practice.



<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: four,
        alt: "Smart mirror showing a dancer with on-screen corrections for arm placement and leg alignment, plus Done and Replay Feedback buttons.",
    }}
    caption={
        "Next Leap delivers clear, real-time corrections to help dancers practice safely and refine their technique."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImageBlock>

Before any attempt, the dancer is asked to confirm prerequisite knowledge such as knowing first and second position, so they never enter a skill unprepared or at risk of injury. The skill tutorial then starts with a short introduction that explains what the movement means, followed by a series of clearly segmented steps. Each step is paired with a verbal explanation and a visual demonstration, helping dancers understand not only how to perform the movement but also why certain positions matter.

Once the dancer transitions from learning to trying the movement, the system introduces a set of customizable session settings. The user can select the number of tries they want before receiving feedback, choose whether or not to use a timer, and adjust music and volume to create a practice environment that feels comfortable and motivating. During each attempt, a clear recording indicator appears to show that their movements are being captured, while a small version of the tutorial plays on the side for quick reference if they need a reminder. After completing their tries, the mirror presents feedback in a step-by-step format rather than overwhelming the dancer with everything at once. Each correction, such as adjusting arm placement or improving knee alignment, appears as its own message and is layered directly over the dancer’s playback so the connection between movement and feedback is easy to understand

### Stay Motivated and Overcome Mental Blocks


Staying motivated during independent practice is often difficult, especially when dancers feel stuck or unsure about their progress. The system supports motivation by offering clear, bite-sized feedback that appears after each attempt, helping users focus on manageable improvements rather than feeling overwhelmed by the full skill. Encouraging language and safety-oriented reminders help reduce frustration and fear of failure, creating a more supportive emotional environment. Features like “next” prompts guide dancers forward at a steady pace through their feedback, helping them stay engaged and move through feedback step by step. 

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: five,
            alt: "Smart mirror showing a ‘Session Complete’ screen with feedback noting improved turns and a View Progress button.",
        },
        {
            src: six,
            alt: "Smart mirror displaying before-and-after images for plié progress with highlighted improvements and a Done button.",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "Next Leap celebrates small wins and shows visible progress to keep dancers motivated and confident in their growth."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

To support dancers in staying motivated and pushing through mental blocks, the system breaks feedback into simple, sequential steps. After an attempt, only one piece of feedback is shown at a time, paired with a clear “Next” button that lets the dancer move forward without feeling overwhelmed. Each tip is short, actionable, and directly tied to the user’s movement, helping them stay focused on one improvement before advancing to the next. The option to replay feedback gives dancers a chance to revisit guidance when they need reassurance or clarity, creating a steady and encouraging rhythm throughout practice.

As the feedback sequence ends, the system shifts toward reinforcing progress by showing a “Session Complete” summary followed by a detailed comparison of the dancer’s first and most recent attempts. This includes side-by-side visuals and a short explanation of what improved, making progress tangible and easy to understand.

The final screen celebrates the dancer for meeting their goal and offers simple next steps—either set a new goal or exit, so users end the session with a sense of accomplishment and forward momentum. These step-by-step features work together to keep dancers encouraged, grounded, and motivated even when the skill feels challenging.

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research aimed to understand how dancers learn new skills, what challenges they face during independent practice, and how instruction in real studios supports safe and confident progression. To explore these questions, we interviewed four dance instructors with expertise in ballet, hip-hop, contemporary, pom, and acro, as well as two student dancers enrolled in pre-professional training programs. These instructors helped us understand how they scaffold skills, assess readiness, and deliver feedback, while the students revealed motivation patterns, frustrations, and learning needs. We also conducted a contextual inquiry at a partner studio, observing classes across age groups and styles to see how feedback, correction, and progression unfold in real time. Together, these methods gave us a grounded understanding of studio learning and shaped the insights described below.


### Multi-Modal Feedback Supports Skill Development

This insight emerged as instructors consistently emphasized that dancers learn best through layered, multisensory feedback. In interviews, instructors described slowing down demonstrations so students could “see where our hands are being placed,” and breaking movements into small, repeatable segments. During contextual inquiry, we observed instructors pairing visual modeling, verbal cues, kinesthetic imagery, and rhythmic timing to help dancers internalize technique. These patterns made it clear that no single form of feedback, whether it's visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, that is sufficient on its own.

This understanding shaped our decision to build multi-modal feedback directly into the system. We incorporated visual body highlights to point out alignment issues, step-by-step on-screen cues to guide pacing, and spoken explanations to mirror instructor language. Together, these elements replicate the layered instruction dancers rely on in class, making corrections more understandable and safer to apply during independent practice.


### Personalized Guidance and Safety-Centered Progression

Our research showed that dancers depend heavily on instructors to determine when they are ready for new skills. Instructors stressed the importance of structured skill progressions and preventing students from “jumping ahead” before mastering foundational movements. Students described feeling unsafe or overwhelmed when attempting skills too early, and our studio observations reinforced how carefully instructors monitor readiness and adjust instruction accordingly. These findings revealed a core need: dancers practicing alone lack the real-time guardrails instructors normally provide.

This insight motivated the inclusion of prerequisite checks that notify dancers of missing foundational skills and link them directly to those tutorials. We also adapted tutorials into short, sequential steps that mirror how instructors break down skills to protect students from injury. Personalized goals further support dancers by allowing them to progress at a pace aligned with their strengths and confidence. By embedding these structures, the system provides the protective scaffolding that dancers would normally receive from an instructor.

### Visualizing Progress Strengthens Motivation and Skill Growth

Both instructors and students emphasized that dancers stay motivated when they can see and feel improvement over time. Students described using mirrors, demonstrations, and past experiences to track their progress, while instructors spoke about revisiting earlier attempts to refine technique. During contextual inquiry, we observed dancers repeatedly checking their reflection or replaying demonstrations to understand how their movement was evolving. These patterns highlighted that visible progress and the ability to compare attempts is central to building confidence and sustaining effort.

This insight shaped the development of our View Progress feature. By allowing users to compare earlier recordings with their most recent attempts, the system makes growth tangible and easy to interpret. Highlighted corrections and improvement notes clarify exactly what is changing and what still needs attention, while next-step suggestions guide continued practice. This mirrors how instructors celebrate improvements and offer targeted feedback, helping dancers stay motivated and trust their learning process.


## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our design iterations highlighted three core breakdowns in how dancers interact with the system: navigating long lists created unnecessary cognitive load, unclear skill progression introduced safety risks, and lack of mid-attempt visual support disrupted learning flow. These issues surfaced through heuristic evaluation and usability testing, not as process steps, but as indicators of where our design failed to support real dance learning. Addressing them led to targeted improvements, including streamlined navigation, clear prerequisite guidance, and real-time visual support. These all collectively shaped a system that better mirrors studio-based instruction and reduces friction during practice.

### Improving Navigation to Reduce Cognitive Load

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: ten,
        alt: "Remote control interface with directional arrows, an OK button, voice search, home, back, power, and media controls.",
    }}
    caption={
        "The updated remote enables faster, more intuitive navigation through skills and dance styles."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our heuristic evaluation made it clear that the original design placed unnecessary cognitive load on dancers. As seen in the paper prototype, users had to scroll through long lists of dance styles and skills, and testers noted that finding a specific skill required “a lot of reading and scanning,” which slowed down practice and made the interface feel overwhelming. This directly violated Recognition Over Recall, as users needed to remember where items were located rather than easily identifying them.

What made the design better was realizing that dancers needed multiple lightweight entry points into the content, and not just lists. In response, we introduced a search bar, voice search, and a favorites section. These additions transformed navigation from a time-consuming scan to a fast, intuitive lookup. This insight significantly improved usability by reducing memory load, eliminating friction during practice, and allowing dancers to move through the system with minimal effort.

### Clarifying Skill Progression to Support Safe Learning

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: eleven,
            alt: "Smart mirror showing a prerequisite check pop-up asking whether the user has learned first and second position before continuing.",
        },
        {
            src: seven,
            alt: "Smart mirror displaying a completion screen with the message ‘Great Work! You met your goal!’ and options to set a new goal or exit.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}   
    caption="Next Leap guides safe progression by checking foundational skills and celebrating completed goals."
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

The need for prerequisite clarity emerged when we saw how the paper prototype let users select advanced skills without any guidance. During evaluation, reviewers raised safety concerns, noting that “high-level skills appeared equally accessible to elementary skills,” which did not reflect how real dance instruction scaffolds learning. Beginners would have no way of knowing whether they were ready to attempt a movement safely. This was not a process insight, but a fundamental design flaw: our interface failed to communicate progression, readiness, and risk.

Our design improved when we reframed this as a learning-support problem, not a blocking problem. Instead of restricting access, we introduced a prerequisite pop-up that lists foundational skills and links dancers to those tutorials. This addition shifted our system toward the logic of actual studio learning, where instructors help dancers advance safely while still giving them autonomy. This insight strengthened the instructional quality and trustworthiness of the system.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Adding Real-Time Visual Support to Maintain Learning Flow


<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: twelve,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "NextLeap guides safe progression by checking foundational skills and celebrating completed goals."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

Usability testing revealed a critical breakdown: once dancers began attempting a skill, many “forgot what the choreography looked like” and had “no way to re-reference the tutorial”. This wasn’t merely a navigation issue, as it exposed a deeper insight about how learning unfolds. Dancing requires visual memory, and losing that reference mid-attempt disrupted flow, increased hesitation, and led to incorrect movements.

This insight led to one of the most impactful improvements in our design: adding a toggleable picture-in-picture tutorial window. The revised prototype shows how dancers can keep a small moving reference visible or hide it for a clean interface. This flexibility mirrors real studio environments, where instructors often demonstrate movements alongside dancers. It transformed attempt mode from a “recording state” into a true learning state, offering continuous support without interrupting practice.
