## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Food is a cornerstone of cultural identity, community, and heritage. It reflects who we are, where we come from,
and how we connect with others. Engaging with cultural foods when traveling can present a challenge to some.
Barriers such as accessibility, reliability, and exposure can limit how people experience and appreciate the
food and culture.

Food Passport transforms cultural discovery into a guided culinary journey. Users select a set of
tasks from a set of guided activities such as trying a new dish/restaurant, reading up on reviews,
and watching videos made by other users. Users complete those tasks to enrich their cultural understanding
and insight. Over time, users will earn “passport stamps” which function as community badges.
Food Passport celebrates food as a dynamic expression of identity, community connection, and personal growth.


</ProjectImageBlock>

Our goal in this introduction is to establish why cultural food exploration matters and to clearly frame the barriers
that prevent people from engaging with it meaningfully. By highlighting how Food Passport transforms this challenge into
an intentional, guided experience, we aim to spark curiosity and motivate users to learn more about how our design
supports cultural connection, personal growth, and community engagement. This overview sets the stage for understanding
not just what our app does, but why it matters and why the rest of our work is worth exploring.

## Design Walkthrough

As part of Food Passport’s goal to make cultural food exploration more intentional and accessible, our two focus
tasks highlight the core moments where users actively engage with new cuisines and reflect on their experiences.
First, “Develop and Increase Comfort to Try Unfamiliar Cuisines” guides users through curated activities that reduce
uncertainty and build confidence when exploring foods outside their comfort zone. The second task “Evaluate and
Reflect on the Experience” helps users process what they learned, document their cultural insights, and earn
meaningful “passport stamps” that reinforce growth over time. Together, these tasks showcase how our design supports
both the action and reflection needed for deeper cultural connection and personal development.

### Develop and Increase Comfort to Try Unfamiliar Cuisines

To develop and increase comfort to try unfamiliar cuisines, Food Passport allows users to select from a list
of curated tasks that reduce uncertainty and build confidence when exploring foods outside of their comfort
zone. The tasks come in several forms including:

 * __Learn:__ The user gains insight or context about foods.
 * __Taste:__ The user goes to a restaurant, tries a certain food, or cooks with a recipe.
 * __Review:__ The user reviews and reflects on an experience.

The tasks are curated based on a user's travel details but still allows flexibility in deciding what
they are and are not prepared for. The full process is displayed below.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: countrySelectImage,
            alt: "Step 1",
        },
        {
            src: tripDetailsImage,
            alt: "Step 2",
        },
        {
            src: taskSelectionImage,
            alt: "Step 3",
        },

        },
        {
            src: checklistCreatedImage,
            alt: "Step 5",
        },
        {
            src: checklistImage,
            alt: "Step 6",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Creating a Checklist for USA Exploration"
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Evaluate and Reflect on the Experience

After completing tasks, users are asked to fill out a short review on the experience. This is small
and used to encourage short reflection and evaluation of the task.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: reviewImage,
        alt: "Screen of Review Page"
    }}
    caption={
        "Review Page."
    }
    width={4}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImageBlock>

Users are also able to keep track of their past reviews and edit those less than 24 hours old.
They also have access to all of their previous reflections, restaurants visited and more.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: profileImage,
            alt: "Profile Page.",
        },
        {
            src: pastReviewsImage,
            alt: "Editing an old review less than 24 hours old.",
        },
        {
            src: personalReflectionImage,
            alt: "Reflections for each country.",
        },
        {
            src: usPersonalReflection,
            alt: "Reflections for United States",
        }
    ]}
    caption={
        "Some of the review aspects."
    }
    width={4}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research aimed to understand how people discover new foods, what makes unfamiliar
cuisines intimidating. And how users build cultural understanding through their food experience.
We took the time to conduct structured interviews with students and adults who enjoy exploring restaurants
but often rely on the tools that already exist such as Yelp or Tiktok. We chose this method to gather the stories,
emotions and their personal motivation, since food discovery is deeply tied to comfort, identity, and social connection.
Through the quarter, we work to gather insights through critique, heuristic evaluations, and usability tests,
which reveal gaps between our intention and how users actually understood our interaction with the early prototypes.
This combination of the interview with the iterative testing shape the foundation of the Food Passport.

### Food is Emotional: Seek Comfort, Connection, and Cultural  eaning

How we learn this:

During the interview we conduct before any design, participants consistently describe food as a way
to feel connected, find comfort, or explore identity. One participant had shared that trying food from
home makes them feel grounded, while another had said they try new cuisine to understand people better.

Evidence: 

One of the participants said “I don’t like seafood so I stayed away from sushi spots and stuff…but I did go
to the McDonalds there once which had different items than over here (USA).” They look for familiar food and
they are ok with some changes. Another person said “I usually travel within Washington but sometimes go out
of state once a year… I love trying new foods as much as possible! When I cook, I usually tend to stick to
whatever I already know how to cook but when I go out to eat, I try to find new places or cuisines to try”.
The participant connects to food exploration through curiosity and discovery when they can’t travel.

How this shape our design:

This led directly to the concept of the passport stamps and a cultural journey, not just restaurant finders.
Our app celebrates progress, reflection and learning instead of just merely on rating or transaction. It
grounded our design in personal growth, not consumption.

### People Avoid Unfamiliar Foods when the Learning Feels Intimidating or Boring

How we learn this:
In both the interview and early paper prototype testing, use mentioned skipping or overlooking anything
that felt like “reading and article” etc. In usability tests we notice that the tester ignores or overlooks
the “Learn” task due to it blended into the interface looping like a plane button.

Evidence:

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: taskSelectionPaperImage,
            alt: "Paper Prototype for Task Selection.",
        },
        {
            src: taskSelectionImage,
            alt: "Refined Digital Mockup for Task Selection.",
        }
    ]}
    caption={
        "Shift of Paper Prototype to Digital Mockup of Task Selection."
    }
    width={4}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

How this shape our design:

We redesigned the Learn task to be more visual, structured, and interactive, shifting from the bottom
to like more of a micro lesson.  This reduced intimidation and encouraged cultural explorations.

### Users Want to Track Progress and Reflect

How we learned this:
Several participants said they liked the idea of seeing what they’ve tried over time like a journal.
During the usability test, testers naturally tried to navigate back to their past task to see their progress
and see their reflections.

Evidence:

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: pastReviewsImage,
            alt: "Past Reviews.",
        },
        {
            src: personalReflectionImage,
            alt: "Personal Reflections.",
        }
    ]}
    caption={
        "These are parts of the apps where there is the review and the personal reflection page.."
    }
    width={4}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

How this shaped our design:

We create personal reflection and past reviews that allow the user to return to their journey and review
cultural insight. This transforms the Food Passport from a checklist into a long-term personal growth tool.
