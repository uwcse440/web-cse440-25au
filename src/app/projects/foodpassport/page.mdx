## Problem and Design Overview

Food is a cornerstone of cultural identity, community, and heritage. It reflects who we are, where we come from,
and how we connect with others. Engaging with cultural foods when traveling can present a challenge to some.
Barriers such as accessibility, reliability, and exposure limit how people experience and appreciate new
food and culture.

Food Passport transforms cultural discovery into a guided culinary journey. Travellers choose tasks from a range of
activities that include trying a new dish or restaurant, reading reviews, or watching community-made videos.
Tasks are completed, barriers are broken, new cuisines are tried, and "passport stamps " are earned which function
as community badges. Food Passport celebrates food as a dynamic expression of identity, community connection, and personal growth.

</ProjectImageBlock>

Our mission is to establish why cultural food exploration matters and to clearly frame the barriers
that prevent people from engaging with it meaningfully. By highlighting how Food Passport transforms this challenge into
an intentional and guided experience, we aim to spark curiosity and motivate, supporting cultural connection, 
personal growth, and community engagement.

## Design Walkthrough

As part of our goal to make cultural food exploration more intentional and accessible, our two focus
tasks highlight key moments of engagement with new cuisines and personal reflection. “Develop and Increase
Comfort to Try Unfamiliar Cuisines” guides users through curated activities that reduce
uncertainty and build confidence when exploring foods outside their comfort zone. “Evaluate and
Reflect on the Experience” supports depper processing, documentation of cultural insights, and the earning of
meaningful "passport stamps." Together, these tasks encourage both action and reflection, fostering
stronger cultural connection and personal growth.

### Develop and Increase Comfort to Try Unfamiliar Cuisines

Food Passport enables the creation of a personalized task checklist built from curated activities designed 
to reduce uncertainty and build confidence when exploring foods outside one’s comfort zone. The tasks include:

 * __Learn:__ Gain insight or context about foods and cultures.
 * __Taste:__ Go to a restaurant, try a certain food, or cook with a provided recipe.
 * __Review:__ Review or read reviews about certain experiences.

The tasks are curated based on travel details and allow flexibility based on personal interests. Manual task selection
can be skipped by auto-generating the tasks after selecting a desired country. The full process is displayed below.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Evaluate and Reflect on the Experience

After completing a task, a brief review is prompted to evaluate the experience’s effectiveness and enjoyability.
This quick reflection helps determine whether the task remains relevant and worth repeating. The review can also
be deferred if a proper evaluation isn’t possible in the moment.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
        src: reviewNowImage,
        alt: "Review Now or Later"
        },
        {
        src: reviewImage,
        alt: "Review Prompt"
        },
        {
        src: reviewConfirmImage,
        alt: "Confirm Review as Received"
        }
    ]}
    caption={
        "Review Pages."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

A more comprehensive reflection is available after all tasks are finished and a passport stamp is earned. Unlike the brief
reviews, this final reflection centers on which parts of the checklist were most helpful and what cultural insights were
gained through engaging with different foods.

Past reviews can be tracked and edited for a limited 24 hour period. This limit maintains authenticity while allowing minor corrections.
All previous reflections, restaurants visited, and related activity records remain easily accessible, but non-changeable.

        },
        {

            alt: "Reflections for each country.",
        },
        {

            alt: "Reflections for United States",
        }

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research explored how people discover new foods, the challenges they encounter, and how 
cultural understanding develops through their food experiences.
We conducted semi-structured interviews with four participants who frequently travel or have lived abroad.
The participants included:
 
 * __Participant 1:__ Retired ex-military, deployed multiple tiems, frequent traveller, last travelled to Japan.
 * __Participant 2:__ Cambodian student, studied abroad.
 * __Participant 3:__ College staff, travels semi-frequently, last travelled to Spain.
 * __Participant 4:__ Part-time college student, travels out of country once a year and out of state once every two months.

We hand picked this group for their exposure to multiple cultures and their deeper connections
to certain foods and cultures. Personal structured interviews alowed us to capture personal stories, emotions, and motivations-insights that
other research methods would be less likely to reveal. From these
conversations, we identified three key insights:

### Food is Emotional: Seek Comfort, Connection, and Cultural Meaning

Participants consistently described food as a way connect with their culture/community, seek comfort, or explore identity.
One participant shared that eating food from home makes them feel grounded, while another tries new cuisines to
better understand people. A different participant explained, “I don’t like seafood so I stayed away from sushi spots
and stuff...but I did go to the McDonald's (in Japan) once which had different items than over here (USA).” This highlighted a pattern: many
seek familiarity while still being open to small changes.

Another participant noted, “I usually travel within my home state but sometimes go out of state once a year...I love trying new foods as much as possible! When I cook, I
usually tend to stick to whatever I already know how to cook but when I go out to eat, I try to find new places or cuisines.”
This showed that even without frequent travel, food becomes a pathway for curiosity and discovery.

These insights directly informed our concept of passport stamps and the idea of a cultural journey. Food Passport emphasizes learning, progress, and
reflection—distinguishing it from existing restaurant-finder apps that focus primarily on ratings or transactions. Our design centers on personal growth rather than consumption.

### Users Want to Track Progress and Reflect

Several participants expressed interest in seeing their progress over time, similar to a journal. To support this, we created dedicated sections for personal reflections and
access to past reviews, allowing individuals to evaluate their overall journey. We also added shortcuts to make these features easier to navigate. By enabling progress
tracking and deeper reflection, Food Passport becomes more than a checklist—it evolves into a long-term personal growth tool.

    images={[
        {
            src: pastReviewsImage,
            alt: "Past Reviews.",
        },
        {
            src: personalReflectionImage,
            alt: "Personal Reflections.",
        }
    ]}
    caption={
        "Viewing old reviews and adding personal journal entries."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Accessibility and Familiarity are Barriers

Through interviews we found that traveling is not possible for many people due to financial, physical, or personal
reasons among others. Due to this, accessibility to cultural experiences are not the same for everyone. One participant
adds that cultural barriers such as the method of eating or customs can make it difficult to try new things.

This insight became the basis of two aspects of our design. First, we added the country and stamp ideas to accommodate
for users who lack the ability to travel. This brings the traveling aspect to them and allows for them to continue their
food exploration from wherever they are. We also incorporated a live-location feature to identify local places that users
could try that give a similar experience. Second, we added the "Learn" subcategory of tasks which help users learn important
context, history, or lessons that are immersive and help break down the wall of unfamiliarity.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process combined paper prototyping, heuristic evaluations (inspection), usability testing, and a digital mockup
to progressively refine our concept. Paper prototypes helped us explore the design space, understand our target
users, and identify the core feature flows. Heuristic evaluations and usability testing then highlighted underdeveloped areas,
especially the unintuitive flows for leaving reviews, obtaining stamps, and navigating between screens. These insights
revealed gaps we failed to fully consider during early prototyping. We used this feedback to create the digital mockup which
improved navigation, redesigned the task checklist for earning a stamp, and expanded the review and edit-review flows,
ultimately making the interface more intuitive and cohesive.

    }}

        "Paper Prototype."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImageBlock>

### People Avoid Learning that is Intimidating or Boring

In the interviews, participants mentioned that they gained most of their food recommendations from social media,
community forums, or local recommendations. They also claimed that they would avoid anything that felt like
"reading an article." We were mindful of this when creating our designs and tried to avoid this feeling
by adding a sense of accomplishment through stamps and achievements. Despite this, our heuristic evaluations
uncovered that many of our screens were too text-heavy. Since this linked with the feeling of "reading an article", we
revised the paper prototype to eliminate the unnecessary text. In our usability testing, some participants
noted that the Task Checklist page was very expansive but it was unclear how long it should take to complete which could
make other users quit early since it is boring to set up.

We redesigned the interface to be more visual, structured, and interactive. First, we increased the visibility of task
selection progress by adding a progress bar on the top of the screen for each major step. This was done to discourage
user early exits. We also minimized text and added drop-down menus on each page to reduce clutter. Finally, we focused on
shifting tasks to be more digestible micro-lessons which aimed to reduce intimidation and encourage cultural exploration.

            alt: "Paper Prototype for Review.",
        },
        {

            alt: "Paper Prototype for Task Selection.",
        },
        {

            alt: "Refined Digital Mockup for Task Selection.",
        }

### User Freedom and Navigation

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: tripDetailsPaperImage,
            alt: "Trip Details Paper Prototype.",
        },
        {
            src: tripDetailsImage,
            alt: "Trip Details Digital Mockup.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Addition of Navigation Buttons."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"350px"}
>

In our heuristic evaluations, many of the evaluators noted that our paper prototype was difficult to navigate. The primary
cause of this was the lack of navigation buttons. When designing the paper prototype, we were too focused on
creating the main pages and features that we overlooked the intermediate pages and actions that a user needs.
We added navigation buttons to the paper prototype prior to starting usability testing. Despite this, our paper prototype
only had the necessary screens for our two focus tasks. Therefore, when an evaluator attempted to make an unsupported
action, we noted it down so we could incorporate it into our digital mockup. For example, one user wanted to go back to
their old reviews and edit it. Although we did not support this initially, we revised our design to add a 24 hour time
limit to edit reviews. This allows the user to fix any mistakes or add clarifications to their reviews without completely
changing the thoughts/feelings that they originally had.

### Ensuring Actual Learning and Exploration

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: ratePaperImage,
            alt: "Rate Experience Paper Prototype.",
        },
        {
            src: reviewFinalImage,
            alt: "Final Review Digital Mockup.",
        },
    ]}
    caption={"Reflection Paper Prototype to Digital Mockup."}
    direction={"row"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"240px"}
>

During usability testing, one evaluator questioned how we can ensure that actual learning occurs if a user selects
only “Learn” tasks, but then skips through the content without actually engaging to earn stamps quickly. We addressed this
by adding short review/reflection questions after each task in addition to the final reflection to try promoting internal
thinking. Another evaluator noted that the reflection questions were too vague to garner any actual insight and could
also be intimidating to answer due to its scope. We revised the questions to be more specific to the task
which should make it easier to recall and reflect on.
