## Problem and Design Overview

Food is a cornerstone of cultural identity, community, and heritage. It reflects who we are, where we come from,
and how we connect with others. Engaging with cultural foods when traveling can present a challenge to some.
Barriers such as accessibility, reliability, and exposure limit how people experience and appreciate the
food and culture.

Food Passport transforms cultural discovery into a guided culinary journey. Users select a list of
tasks from a set of guided activities such as trying a new dish/restaurant, reading up on reviews,
and watching videos made by other users. Users complete these tasks to enrich their cultural understanding
and insight. Over time, users will earn “passport stamps” which function as community badges.
Food Passport celebrates food as a dynamic expression of identity, community connection, and personal growth.

</ProjectImageBlock>

Our goal in this introduction is to establish why cultural food exploration matters and to clearly frame the barriers
that prevent people from engaging with it meaningfully. By highlighting how Food Passport transforms this challenge into
an intentional and guided experience, we aim to spark curiosity and motivate users to learn more about how our design
supports cultural connection, personal growth, and community engagement. This overview sets the stage for understanding
not just what our app does, but why it matters and why the rest of our work is worth exploring.

## Design Walkthrough

As part of Food Passport’s goal to make cultural food exploration more intentional and accessible, our two focus
tasks highlight the core moments where users actively engage with new cuisines and reflect on their experiences.
First, “Develop and Increase Comfort to Try Unfamiliar Cuisines” guides users through curated activities that reduce
uncertainty and build confidence when exploring foods outside their comfort zone. The second task, “Evaluate and
Reflect on the Experience” helps users process what they learned, document their cultural insights, and earn
meaningful “passport stamps” that reinforce growth over time. Together, these tasks showcase how our design supports
both the action and reflection needed for deeper cultural connection and personal development.

### Develop and Increase Comfort to Try Unfamiliar Cuisines

Food Passport allows users to build a customized task checklist by selecting from a list of curated tasks that aim to
reduce uncertainty and build confidence when exploring foods outside of their comfort zone. The tasks come in several
forms including:

 * __Learn:__ Gain insight or context about foods and cultures.
 * __Taste:__ Go to a restaurant, try a certain food, or cook with a provided recipe.
 * __Review:__ Review or read reviews about certain experiences.

The tasks are curated based on a user's travel details but still allows flexibility in deciding what
they are and are not interested in. Users may also skip this process by auto-generating the tasks after selecting their
desired country. The full process is displayed below.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Evaluate and Reflect on the Experience

After completing tasks, users are asked to fill out a short review on the experience. This review is quick and allows
the user to evaluate the overall task in terms of effectiveness and enjoyability. This is used to ease the user into
further thinking and to evaluate if the task is relevant and should continue to be used. Users can also decide to defer
the review process until later in the case where they are not able to properly evaluate at the current moment.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
        src: reviewNowImage,
        alt: "Review Now or Later"
        },
        {
        src: reviewImage,
        alt: "Review Prompt"
        },
        {
        src: reviewConfirmImage,
        alt: "Confirm Review as Received"
        }
    ]}
    caption={
        "Review Pages."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

There is also a more comprehensive reflection once a user completes all of their tasks and achieves the passport stamp.
Compared to the small reviews, this final reflection focuses on what parts of the task checklist were most useful
and what the user learned about the culture by interacting with foods.

Users are also able to keep track of their past reviews and edit ones that are less than 24 hours old. The 24 hour time
limit is used to preserve the authenticity of the reviews and allow edits to minor mistakes. They can access all of their
previous reflections, restaurants visited, and more.

        },

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research aimed to understand how people discover new foods, challenges they face, and how people
build cultural understanding through their food experience.
We conducted semi-structured interviews with four students and adults who frequently travel or live abroad.
The participants included:
 
 * __Participant 1:__ Retired ex-military, deployed multiple tiems, frequent traveller, last travelled to Japan.
 * __Participant 2:__ Cambodian student, studied abroad.
 * __Participant 3:__ College staff, travels semi-frequently, last travelled to Spain.
 * __Participant 4:__ Part-time college student, travels out of country once a year and out of state once every two months.

We chose this group since they had perspectives of multiple cultures and likely had deeper and very valuable connections
to certain foods and cultures. We used interviews to gather the stories, emotions, and their personal motivation since
other research methods are less likely to garner the same insightful qualitative information. From these
interviews, we came away with the following three key insights.

### Food is Emotional: Seek Comfort, Connection, and Cultural Meaning

Participants consistently described food as a way connect with their culture/community, find comfort, or explore identity.
One participant shared that trying food from home makes them feel grounded, while another stated they try new cuisines to
understand people better. Moreover, one of the participants claimed “I don’t like seafood so I stayed away from sushi spots
and stuff...but I did go to the McDonald's (in Japan) once which had different items than over here (USA).” From this, we
learned that they look for familiar food but are fine exploring some changes. Another participant said “I usually travel within
(my home state) but sometimes go out of state once a year...I love trying new foods as much as possible! When I cook, I
usually tend to stick to whatever I already know how to cook but when I go out to eat, I try to find new places or cuisines
to try.” We learned that people who aren't able to travel connect to food exploration through curiosity and discovery. This
directly led to the concept of the passport stamps and our focus on cultural journey which distinguishes Food Passport from
existing restaurant finders. Food Passport celebrates learning, progress, and reflection instead of merely relying on ratings or
transactions. It grounded our design in personal growth, not consumption.

### Users Want to Track Progress and Reflect

Several participants expressed that they liked the idea of seeing what they’ve done over time like a journal so they could
reflect on their progress. To facilitate this task, we created sections for users to add personal reflections and access past reviews so the user
can examine and evaluate their overall journey. We also added shortcuts to both of these options to provide clearer navigation
and accessibility. Adding the ability to track progress and reflect transforms the Food Passport from a checklist into a
long-term personal growth tool.

        {
            src: pastReviewsImage,
            alt: "Past Reviews.",
        },
        {
            src: personalReflectionImage,
            alt: "Personal Reflections.",
        }
    ]}
    caption={
        "Viewing old reviews and adding personal journal entries."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Accessibility and Familiarity are Barriers

Through interviews we found that traveling is not possible for many people due to financial, physical, or personal
reasons among others. Due to this, accessibility to cultural experiences are not the same for everyone. One participant
adds that cultural barriers such as the method of eating or customs can make it difficult to try new things.

This insight became the basis of two aspects of our design. First, we added the country and stamp ideas to accommodate
for users who lack the ability to travel. This brings the traveling aspect to them and allows for them to continue their
food exploration from wherever they are. We also incorporated a live-location feature to identify local places that users
could try that give a similar experience. Second, we added the "Learn" subcategory of tasks which help users learn important
context, history, or lessons that are immersive and help break down the wall of unfamiliarity.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process combined paper prototyping, heuristic evaluations (inspection), usability testing, and a digital mockup
to progressively refine our concept. Paper prototypes helped us explore the design space, understand our target
users, and identify the core feature flows. Heuristic evaluations and usability testing then highlighted underdeveloped areas,
especially the unintuitive flows for leaving reviews, obtaining stamps, and navigating between screens. These insights
revealed gaps we failed to fully consider during early prototyping. We used this feedback to create the digital mockup which
improved navigation, redesigned the task checklist for earning a stamp, and expanded the review and edit-review flows,
ultimately making the interface more intuitive and cohesive.

    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}

### People Avoid Learning that is Intimidating or Boring

In the interviews, participants mentioned that they gained most of their food recommendations from social media,
community forums, or local recommendations. They also claimed that they would avoid anything that felt like
"reading an article." We were mindful of this when creating our designs and tried to avoid this feeling
by adding a sense of accomplishment through stamps and achievements. Despite this, our heuristic evaluations
uncovered that many of our screens were too text-heavy. Since this linked with the feeling of "reading an article", we
revised the paper prototype to eliminate the unnecessary text. In our usability testing, some participants
noted that the Task Checklist page was very expansive but it was unclear how long it should take to complete which could
make other users quit early since it is boring to set up.

We redesigned the interface to be more visual, structured, and interactive. First, we increased the visibility of task
selection progress by adding a progress bar on the top of the screen for each major step. This was done to discourage
user early exits. We also minimized text and added drop-down menus on each page to reduce clutter. Finally, we focused on
shifting tasks to be more digestible micro-lessons which aimed to reduce intimidation and encourage cultural exploration.

        },
        {
            src: reviewPaperImage,
            alt: "Paper Prototype for Review.",
        },
        {
            src: taskSelectionPaperImage,
            alt: "Paper Prototype for Task Selection.",
        },
        {
            src: taskSelectionImage,
            alt: "Refined Digital Mockup for Task Selection.",
        }
    ]}

        "Initial Paper Prototype to Final Paper Prototype to Digital Mockup."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"300px"}

### User Freedom and Navigation

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: tripDetailsPaperImage,
            alt: "Trip Details Paper Prototype.",
        },
        {
            src: tripDetailsImage,
            alt: "Trip Details Digital Mockup.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Addition of Navigation Buttons."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"350px"}
>

In our heuristic evaluations, many of the evaluators noted that our paper prototype was difficult to navigate. The primary
cause of this was the lack of navigation buttons. When designing the paper prototype, we were too focused on
creating the main pages and features that we overlooked the intermediate pages and actions that a user needs.
We added navigation buttons to the paper prototype prior to starting usability testing. Despite this, our paper prototype
only had the necessary screens for our two focus tasks. Therefore, when an evaluator attempted to make an unsupported
action, we noted it down so we could incorporate it into our digital mockup. For example, one user wanted to go back to
their old reviews and edit it. Although we did not support this initially, we revised our design to add a 24 hour time
limit to edit reviews. This allows the user to fix any mistakes or add clarifications to their reviews without completely
changing the thoughts/feelings that they originally had.

### Ensuring Actual Learning and Exploration

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: ratePaperImage,
            alt: "Rate Experience Paper Prototype.",
        },
        {
            src: reviewFinalImage,
            alt: "Final Review Digital Mockup.",
        },
    ]}
    caption={"Reflection Paper Prototype to Digital Mockup."}
    direction={"row"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"240px"}
>

During usability testing, one evaluator questioned how we can ensure that actual learning occurs if a user selects
only “Learn” tasks, but then skips through the content without actually engaging to earn stamps quickly. We addressed this
by adding short review/reflection questions after each task in addition to the final reflection to try promoting internal
thinking. Another evaluator noted that the reflection questions were too vague to garner any actual insight and could
also be intimidating to answer due to its scope. We revised the questions to be more specific to the task
which should make it easier to recall and reflect on.
