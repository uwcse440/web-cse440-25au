Navigating campus life can often place students in situations where they might feel uncertain or unsafe, 
such as exploring new areas, walking alone at night, or encountering new interactions. Most current safety 
tools fall short in providing immediate guidance or rapid response when an individual feels vulnerable. 
There is needs to be a solution that provides individuals with options, support, and direct connections 
to trusted help if situations escalate.

Our design, CampusKey, supports users in making confident decisions through a physical, clickable keychain device accompanied 
by an mobile application. This innovative design lets users instantly connect with a preselected group of trusted 
peers or emergency services at the click of a button, empowering them with a sense of security and confidence. 
The accompanying app provides a place for users to manage their safety network and access all keychain functionalities 
digitally, reinforcing an adaptable safety system that supports people on campus.

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Design Walkthrough

To demonstrate the core functionalities of CampusKey, we focused on two critical tasks: 
contacting registered trusted friends for peer support and requesting immediate help from
emergency services. These scenarios represent how both the physical keychain and mobile 
application enable the system to provide rapid, context-appropriate aid. The motivation 
behind these tasks is to help the user feel socially confident, that a buddy could 
be found or friends were alerted, and to provide essential preparedness for 
emergencies by empowering the user with clear options in any situation.

### Initial Setup and Configuration

Before enabling either of the support functions, the user has to set up their safety 
network within the CampusKey mobile app.

Profile Setup: The user registers their personal information, including contact details 
and, if desired, critical health information.

Registration of Trusted Friends: User selects and registers trusted contacts who would be 
contacted during a help request.

Emergency Services Permissions: The user configures their preferred emergency contact, 
such as 911 or Campus Safety, and sets privacy permissions, determining whether their 
live location and health information will be shared with emergency responders when 
activated.

### Requesting Emergency Services for Immediate Help

This task offers a direct and quick route to expert assistance for critical situations.

User Activation:

        },
    ]}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}

</ProjectImagesBlock>

System Response:

The system automatically calls the user's pre-set emergency contact, such as 911 or Campus Safety. A confirmation text message
is sent to the user, informing them that emergency services have been alerted and are on their way. Depending on the permissions
set during the setting up of the app, key information about the user, including their live location and any health data, is securely 
shared with emergency responders so that they will come prepared. Note: The user will not be able to see the live location of the emergency 
services vehicles as they would when using the friends function; however, they will know via text that help is on the way.

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research focused on understanding the emotional and behavioral factors that contribute to the 
sense of safety or unsafety among University of Washington students on and around the Seattle campus and in the U-District 
area. Our primary goal was to target beyond simple technical challenges, such as a lack of alerts, to instead understand the 
user's need for guidance, options, and support at moments of uncertainty. We conducted semi-structured interviews, approximately 
30 minutes each, with a diverse group of current UW undergraduate and graduate students representing different genders, backgrounds, 
and travel patterns across campus. We chose this method because in-person, conversational interviews provide a comfortable setting 
for participants to share detailed experiences that are closely aligned with real life for our target users and reveal deeper 
design opportunities than quantitative surveys.

### Confidence is Built by Immediate Social Support

A trusted companion greatly increases the perceived safety of an environment, 
which proved to be a main factor in decreasing fear and anxiety. Throughout the 
interviews, participants identified that the absence of social presence greatly 
lowers their sense of security, especially when walking alone at night. From this, 
our solution needed to focus on the features that provide the most social connectivity. 
For instance, Participant 1 said, "One of the biggest benefits of living in the sorority 
house is living with 80 people gives me a good chance someone is walking home the same 
time as me . . . I hate walking alone at night." As a result, we shifted our design focus 
from strictly location alerts to developing a system that facilitates an immediate 
request for a "buddy check-in" or "walk-with," making the digital presence of others 
reassuring like the physical presence.

### The "Brain Freeze" Effect Demands Guided Response Strategies

A major finding was that the internal response to an unsafe situation is often marked 
by disorientation and the inability to take immediate, actionable steps. Users 
articulated that the source of feeling unsafe did not come from the danger itself, but 
from a lack of knowledge on how to act appropriately. This inability to determine how 
to best navigate high-stress moments led us to fundamentally shift our design problem 
from providing generalized alerts about dangerous areas to supporting an individual who 
is unsure how to face an unsafe situation. This is reflected by Participant 2: "When I 
find myself in an unsafe situation near campus, my brain just freezes. I don't know 
whether to run or call for help. Sometimes I just wish a system could help me calm down 
and give me ordered, clear instructions on how to mitigate a situation." This insight 
drove the need for a solution that provided immediate, easy-to-follow, customized 
guidance and connection options-like calling friends or 911-integrated into our keychain 
and app designs.

### Safety Sentiment is Deeply Influenced by Prior Knowledge and Experience

Safety is a very subjective feeling and highly dependent on external information,
personal experience, and familiarity with a place. The participants who were not
from an area or who had been exposed to any negative stories were much less secure
when compared to the participants that knew the surroundings. This really pointed
out the need for personalized context rather than raw statistics of crime. Participant
3 said, “I think feeling safe or unsafe depends on what I know or don’t know about
an area. I was always checking around us because it was also nighttime and I was
not very familiar with the area. I had also previously heard about incidents going
on in this area.” This further strengthened our decision to build a platform for
confidence through empowering the user to act and not just warning them. The
shift was to be made from focusing on the external, area-based danger to the 
provision of internal resources to the individual for feeling confident enough to 
navigate any environment.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process moved from initial paper prototypes, 
heuristic evaluations, and user-centered usability testing before evolving into
the final digital mockup. The initial paper prototype reflects two key 
decisions: centralizing all personal and emergency settings within the mobile application 
for consistency in management and limiting the function of the physical keychain to being 
no more than a simple, immediate contact activation tool. This approach helped 
ensure that core interactions were intuitive, even in high-stress situations. Inspection 
and testing beyond this provided issues related to system clarity 
and usability to help us move from complex to simpler, more reliable interactions.

### Simplifying Complex Interactions for High-Stress Scenarios

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
        src: initialKeychain,
        alt: "Before image of keychain prototype with 1 button, no activation lever, and pattern clicking.",
        },
        {
        src: keychain,
        alt: "After image of keychain prototype with 2 buttons, activation lever, and no pattern clicking.",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "Shift from patterned clicking to separate buttons with activation lever to prevent confusion and accidental clicking."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We greatly simplified the main activation mechanism by removing pattern-based input for more clear, 
dedicated buttons. The initial design for the keychain overcomplicated things: the user had to remember 
and perform a specific clicking pattern (e.g., two clicks for friends, three for emergency services) to 
differentiate the request for support. Heuristic evaluations immediately flagged this as violating the 
Recognition Rather than Recall principle, which states that complex memorized patterns are infeasible 
under stress. Additionally, usability testing showed subjects were confused as to which button 
corresponded to which service. To fix this, we iterated to a design with two distinct buttons, each clearly 
illustrated with a dedicated icon, one for Friends and one for Emergency Services. We also included an 
error-prevention mechanism, a safety lever that the user must engage before a click is registered, reducing the 
chances of accidental activation.

### Capturing Critical Information to Maximize User Safety

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: initialProfile,
            alt: "Before image of profile page with only patterns, friends, and emergency services.",
        },
        {
            src: profilePage,
            alt: "After image of profile page with health records, no patterns, and separate screens for friends and emergency services.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Shift from minimized profile information to health and user information for security and confidence."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We improved the setup of the user profile to include  
sharing of relevant health information in case of emergency response. Our 
initial design was directed only at contacting friends and emergency numbers 
and did not capture potentially life-saving data. Heuristic evaluations identified 
this as a gap in maximizing user safety, especially in cases where the user cannot 
communicate verbally because they have been incapacitated. This led us to reassess 
the Profile configuration in the app to allow the user to provide and securely store 
relevant health and medical information. Critically, we added a privacy toggle to 
allow the user to explicitly control if this sensitive data is shared with emergency 
services on activation to ensure user autonomy while maximizing the potential for 
effective support.

### Ensuring Full Visibility of System Status Across All Parties

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: initialUpdate,
            alt: "Before image where user's keychain buzzes and mobile phone screen of friend that shows user's location.",
            caption: "Initially, only the user's keychain would buzz when their friend accepted or were nearby."
        },
        {
            src: updatedUpdate,
            alt: "After image of status update text messages and mobile phone screen of friend and user's locations to both user and friend.",
            caption: "Now, all of the trusted friends and the user can see where their friend (who accepted) is."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

We improved system visibility by providing real-time status updates to both the requesting user and 
their contacts. Both heuristic evaluations and usability testing pointed out a key issue of the 
original prototype: after activation, the user who initiated the request had no indication of what was 
occurring, representing the lack of the Visibility of System Status heuristic. While friends could view the request, the 
user was unable to confirm acceptance or proximity. This proved a key source of confusion and duress. 
The revised design fixed this situation by having all parties receive real-time updates in the form of 
text notifications and in-app tracking. Importantly, the requesting user interface now showed who accepted 
the request, the current location of the accepted friend, and their live distance on a map, reassuring them 
constantly and allowing them to track the arrival of their support.
