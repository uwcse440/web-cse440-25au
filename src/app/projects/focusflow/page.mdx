## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Balancing coursework, jobs, social commitments, and personal downtime is a constant challenge for students, and the tools meant to help such as Google Calendar, Canvas, Notes apps, and even memory, often make planning feel more overwhelming than helpful. From our interviews and diary studies, we learned that students rarely struggle with knowing what needs to get done. Instead, they struggle with keeping up when their day changes, estimating how long tasks will actually take, and understanding when they’re realistically able to focus. Existing tools feel rigid, time-consuming, and are easily abandoned once life becomes unpredictable.

FocusFlow is designed to reduce this planning burden by introducing Nero, an AI assistant that helps students generate a weekly schedule based on their upcoming priorities, energy levels, and existing commitments. Rather than manually building their entire calendar from scratch, students can review, accept, or adjust Nero’s proposed schedule, giving them a more flexible starting point that reflects how their week might realistically unfold.

The goal of this approach isn’t to automate planning entirely, but to provide guidance and scaffolding. By combining AI-generated suggestions with student control, FocusFlow aims to make weekly planning feel more approachable, less stressful, and more aligned with how students actually live.

## Design Walkthrough

FocusFlow is organized around a weekly planning flow that begins with reflection and ends with schedule generation. 
Our two focus tasks highlight this core experience. The first task, **Reflect on Time Spent During the Week**, helps students review how their last week actually went and give Nero meaningful context about their workload and energy levels. 
The second task, **Generate a Schedule That Fits Priorities**, shows how Nero uses that context and upcoming commitments to draft a realistic weekly plan that students can edit and adapt.


### Reflect on Time Spent During the Week

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Reflection screen summarizing how much time the student spent on school, work, and personal activities over the past week.",
            caption: "Students start by reviewing a simple breakdown of how they spent their time in the previous week.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Nero reflection screen prompting the student to describe what felt manageable or overwhelming.",
            caption: "Nero then prompts students to reflect on what worked, what didn’t, and what they want to change going into the next week.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In this task, students begin the weekly cycle by reviewing how their last week unfolded. 
Nero presents a summary of completed events and time spent across categories like school, work, 
and personal activities, alongside simple visual cues to highlight balance or overload. 
Students then answer a few short reflection prompts about what felt sustainable and what 
caused stress or burnout. This step gives Nero context that a raw calendar can’t capture such 
as which days felt too packed or which routines actually helped so the upcoming plan can be
 grounded in how the student *really* experienced their week.


</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Generate a Schedule That Fits Priorities

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Input screen where the student lists upcoming deadlines, work shifts, and priorities for the week.",
            caption: "Students share their upcoming deadlines, events, and priorities so Nero knows what needs to fit into the week.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Weekly schedule view showing Nero’s first-pass generated schedule.",
            caption: "Nero generates a tentative weekly schedule that balances classes, work, study time, and breaks.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Schedule view with highlighted conflicts and options to adjust or move events.",
            caption: "FocusFlow highlights conflicts and lets students work with Nero to resolve overlaps or unrealistic blocks.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

After reflecting with Nero, students move into planning the upcoming week. 
They first input key details such as deadlines, work shifts, recurring commitments, and how they want to prioritize their time. 
Nero uses this information to generate a tentative weekly schedule in a vertical, timeline-based layout. 
Students can scan the proposed schedule, identify conflicts, and use Nero’s suggestions or manual edits to adjust the plan. 
This flow demonstrates how FocusFlow reduces the effort of starting from scratch while still keeping students in control of the final result.

## Design Research and Key Insights

To better understand how students plan, focus, and manage changing responsibilities, we interviewed six UW undergraduates and a diary study with five additional participants.
 Our goal was to explore how students currently track their time, what challenges disrupt their routines, and how their focus fluctuates throughout the day. 
 Interviews allowed us to uncover emotional and contextual details like stress, burnout, and feelings of guilt around productivity while the diary study captured patterns that students often forget when reflecting later.
Together, these methods gave us a richer picture of the gaps in existing tools and what students actually need from a planning system. 


### Students’ schedules change constantly, and rigid tools break down quickly

Across both interviews and diary entries, students described their routines as unpredictable. Work shifts move, deadlines shift, and energy levels fluctuate throughout the week. One participant said they “use three different tools and still end up rewriting the whole day” when things change. 
 This helped us realize that any solution based on fixed schedules or manual upkeep would fail. 
 Instead, we needed a system that adapts with the student. 
 This insight shaped our decision to design a flexible, AI-supported flow that recalibrates plans when priorities shift.

### Students misjudge time and energy, leading to stress and late nights

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Interview participants often underestimated how long tasks would take: “I think homework will take one hour and it ends up taking three.” 
Diary data also revealed mismatches between perceived and actual productivity. Several “night owl” participants logged their lowest focus at night. 
This pushed us to design features where Nero considers energy patterns and reflects back realistic durations instead of letting students overcommit.

### Students want support and positive reinforcement, not guilt-driven analytics

Students expressed frustration with tools that make them feel behind or “punished” for missing tasks. 
They preferred systems that celebrate progress and help them adjust gently. 
One participant noted they “like doing easy tasks first because it makes me feel accomplished,” identifying the importance of momentum. 
This insight strongly influenced our tone choices for Nero and inspired lighter and reflective check-ins.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process included paper prototyping, heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and finally creating a digital mockup. 
Early prototyping helped us explore layout options and define Nero’s role within the app. 
Heuristic evaluation highlighted structural issues like missing navigation and unclear labeling, while usability testing revealed deeper confusion around how to interact with the AI and how the weekly planning flow worked. 
These cycles helped us refine the interface, clarify the AI’s purpose, and strengthen the overall user journey.

### Missing navigation made core flows confusing

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x800,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
    }}
    caption={
        "A good caption supports helps a reader understand what is important. " +
        "It thus supports skimming and also provides an emphasis on key points of related text."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Heuristic evaluation revealed violations of “User Control and Freedom” because users had no clear way to move between screens. No menu bar, back buttons, or indicators of where they were in the app.
 Usability testing confirmed this when multiple participants became stuck, asking, “How do I get back?” or “Where does this icon go?” 
Iteration: We added a consistent navigation bar, clearer icons, and more visible page titles across the mockup.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### The AI’s purpose was unclear without guidance

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "This caption is applied to the entire block of images. " +
        "See that it spans across the area of the images."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Early prototypes placed Nero on several screens, but participants didn’t know what to ask or what the AI used to make suggestions. 
Some asked, “What does this even do?” during testing. The design also violated the “Recognition, Not Recall” heuristic due to minimal labeling. 
Iteration: We added onboarding text, explanation sections, and suggested prompts to teach students how Nero fits into both reflection and planning.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Reflection and planning screens looked too similar and caused confusion

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder600x300,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "These are two images stacked in a column. " +
                     "Notice that the text on the left is not broken up by the images."
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder600x300,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "These are two images stacked in a column. " +
                     "Notice that the text on the left is not broken up by the images."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

Usability participants mixed up reflection pages and weekly check-ins because titles and layouts were nearly identical. 
One participant asked, “Is this last week or next week?” which caused task breakdowns. 
Iteration: We separated visual styles, added descriptive headings, and clarified system state so students always know whether they’re reviewing the past or planning ahead.
