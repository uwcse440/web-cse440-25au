## Problem and Design Overview

SkinSync is a mobile app which helps users create a skincare routine that works for them and also helps educate users who are new to skincare! This app features a timeline so that users can track their progress towards their skincare goals and create a routine list. Users will create an account and start a questionnaire to get detailed information on the users skin type and concerns. From there SkinSync can recommend products that are compatible with their skin type, goals, and clean ingredient list.

### Problem
People getting into skincare today are often overwhelmed by all the information and advertising when trying to figure out their skin type and skin concerns. There is not an easy way for them to self-diagnose their skin type or conditions without either seeing a dermatologist or testing countless products that often don't work, ultimately wasting time and money.

### Our Solution
SkinSync lets users monitor their skincare progress and discover products tailored to their skin needs or goals. Its social feature allows users to share and read product reviews from others, making it easier to choose what actually works and avoid wasting money.

## Design Walkthrough

SkinSync supports two core user experience when using the app: understanding one’s skin and setting a personalized foundation, and building routines that users can maintain and refine over time.

### Onboarding and Personalization

    Once the survey is complete, a personalized profile is generated, highlighting the user's specific skin needs and goals.

    Users can browse products tailored to their profile, view detailed ingredient analyses, and easily add products to their daily routines.

    The timeline view helps users stay consistent with their morning and evening routines, allowing for easy tracking and adjustments.

## Design Research and Key Insights

We conducted early research to understand how people learn about skincare. To capture a range of perspectives, we recruited three participants with different levels of experience: one complete beginner, one highly engaged skincare user, and one professional (a Sephora employee). This mix gave us insight across multiple knowledge levels and helped us identify key points in flaws and opportunities to address in our design.

### Evaluation insights: heuristic evaluation

One specific heuristic evaluation that was violated was on our product suggestion screen. Where the user is presented with a product that is helpful for their current skin condition situation. This violated the “Match Between System and the Real World” because on the paper screen prototype there was nothing where why this product was suited for the user’s skin type. As well as not adding anything negative about the product so that the user has full transparency about the product.

Another specific heuristic evaluation that was violated was the lack of help and documentation for the user to know. On one of our paper prototype screen we ask about the user’s skin type but there was no option or information for the user to learn more about the different skin type or skin condition. This is important because we’re assuming the user already know something about their skin type and skin condition. We are limiting our application to a limited number of users, by adding information for the user to learn more about the users skin type and skin condition then it can open up to a lot more range of users using our application.

### Evaluation Insights: Usability Testing

One specific feedback that we got from our usability testing that was similar throughout all of our participants was that the lack information on the product suggestion screen. From our participants they have shared out that it was confusing to them why this specific product was being suggested for them. They would of like if there was more information on the product screen page why this is being suggested to them. They also shared out that they would of like it if there was a better indication of how much this product can closely solve their problem or goal. Because before the percentage was lacking a lot of information to the user why the product is suitable for them.

Another specific feedback that we got was the lack of routine building flexibility. From our participants they have shared out that they would like it if they have full freedom of making their routines that is catered towards their goal. They would like it if the app can suggest them products that is catered towards their goal and suggest it in their routine. One interesting perspective feedback that we got from one of our participant was that if a user has no clue of building a routine they would like it if the app can help them with that. For example, guide them through their skin care routine building and help them complete their goal of taking care of their skin.

With these main feedbacks we incorporated by having more detailed product suggestion screen page in our paper prototype that can help the user understand the product being suggested to then. As well as help them guide them through their skin care routine no matter how knowledgeable they are about building one, so that we don’t limit a specific group of users to use our application but instead increase our usability to a wider range of users.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

We created our initial paper prototype from sketches, guided by our two focus tasks. Because this was our first complete version, it went through many revisions. We gathered feedback through a heuristic evaluation, which helped us identify issues in how SkinSync communicates with and guides the user. We also conducted usability testing with a participant interacting with the paper prototype in person. Observing the prototype in real time allowed us to spot breakdowns in the flow and uncover unclear interactions. We documented these issues and made immediate revisions to improve the experience.

### Reflection: Heuristic Evaluation vs. Usability Testing

An portion of our design that received more feedback and revision was from the usability testing while we felt that it was nice to get feedback through the heuristic evaluation we couldn’t get a better idea of the problem and instead had to rely it through text. We favoured more of the usability testing because it was more interactive and real time with the participant with us and watch them interact with our paper prototype. We could also see then specifically in our paper prototype they were confused about. With this level of depth of a feedback we could not get with the heuristic evaluation. The real time feedback and interactive part from the usability we all agree that we could not get from just a heuristic evaluation feedback. Because we were able to catch and ask question to the participant and get real time understanding while performing the usability testing method. There was small feedback that we got from usability testing that could of been a heuristic evaluation , for example we got feedback on the product feedback suggestions and we also noted that we got that same feedback from our heuristic evaluation. There was a lot of overlapping between the two methods but overall we chose the usability testing as the best choice because of the real time component of it.
