## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Our design challenge focuses on supporting university students who want to maintain their 
existing relationships but struggle to do so consistently. Many students face significant barriers 
to social interaction, not because they lack the desire to connect, 
but because they lack the mental energy or space required to initiate it. 
Academic demands, work commitments, and mental-health pressures often 
consume their cognitive bandwidth, making even small social efforts feel overwhelming.

Through our research, we found that one of the most effective ways to lower this 
“activation barrier” is to provide students with timely cues— natural or intentionally 
designed reminders that bring specific friends or social opportunities to mind. 
These cues help externalize the effort of remembering, prompting students to reach 
out when they otherwise might not have the capacity to generate ideas for interaction. 
By integrating such reminders into daily routines, we aim to make sustaining meaningful 
relationships feel more manageable, intuitive, and emotionally rewarding.

## Design Walkthrough

QuackBack is a duck-shaped color-changing trinket and app that delivers contextual cues 
to help students maintain relationships. The trinket will provide visual cues in the real world, 
separated from the busy ecosystem that is our phones. More functionalities to encourage a balance 
in social interaction for the user is then introduced in the app. It combines manual inputs from
the user & the physical duck and limited automatic tracking to surface timely reminders, 
such as photos or messages. Users can pause it when needed, set limits to avoid prolonged silence, 
and sync busy hours for unobtrusive support.

### Reaching Out to Friends

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "This caption is applied to the entire block of images. " +
        "See that it spans across the area of the images."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

QuackBack helps students reconnect by providing subtle, timely cues. 
When you haven’t interacted with a friend for a while, the duck-shaped 
trinket glows red and quacks a couple times, signaling that it might be a good moment to check in. 
Through the companion app, you can open that friend’s profile to review past interaction 
logs—voice notes, photos, or text entries you’ve saved—to remind yourself of shared moments.
These can serve as conversation starters.

After you hang out or catch up, you can easily log the interaction with a quick voice note, 
text entry, or image upload. Note that these interactions aren't just restricted to in-person
interactions, but online as well, if the user allows the app to access call history and text
notification history. This builds a personal history of your relationships that 
QuackBack can draw from in the future. Once you've reconnected, the duck pulses green, 
reflecting a healthy, active connection and reinforcing the positive effort you’ve made.

### Balancing Social Goals and Mental Health

QuackBack supports students in maintaining relationships without overwhelming 
their mental bandwidth. Using the calendar feature, you can import or add your 
schedule to set dedicated “do not disturb” periods. During these times, the duck 
won’t glow red or quack, ensuring it never adds pressure when you’re busy or drained.

If you need additional quiet time beyond what’s on your calendar, the app allows 
you to extend your do-not-disturb period at any moment. You can adjust this through 
the DND button or set a maximum DND duration in the settings. This ensures QuackBack 
respects your boundaries while still helping you stay connected on your own terms.

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our participants were University of Washington students who often felt they weren’t 
meeting their own social expectations, such as common forgetfulness or not reaching out 
as much as they’d like, and who all identified at least one close friend they genuinely 
cared about.

To understand their interaction patterns and barriers, we structured our research 
around two components. First, a personal inventory captured numerical data on how 
often participants communicated, with whom, through which mediums, and in what contexts,
helping us identify behavioral patterns. Second, interviews encouraged students to 
reflect on why they struggle to engage with their existing circles. Together, these methods 
revealed key factors driving dissatisfaction and clarified where support is most needed.


### Comfort and Emotional Well-Being Shape Social Engagement

For many students, emotional safety and personal well-being strongly influence when 
and how they socialize, even with close friends. Participants shared that they only 
engage in social activities when the environment feels comfortable, familiar, or 
aligned with mutual interests. Individuals who appear overly opinionated, judgmental, 
or intense discourage them from initiating conversation. Environments that are crowded, 
high-energy, or sophisticated can trigger anxiety, making them less likely to branch out 
or attend events altogether unless accompanied by a friend they are comfortable with.

They also prioritize physical and emotional health above social obligations. 
Sleep, meals, and personal routines take precedence, and if they feel tired or 
mentally unwell, they intentionally withdraw from most social interaction until 
they regain stability. This highlights how maintaining well-being is essential for 
enabling consistent, meaningful social interaction.

### Obligations Override Social Intentions

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

College students consistently prioritize academics, career responsibilities, 
and their physical and emotional well-being before choosing to socialize. 
When they feel stressed, short on time, emotionally drained, 
anxious, or tired, they intentionally withdraw from interactions. This makes spontaneous 
or casual connections difficult, especially in environments that feel overwhelming, 
unfamiliar, or unsafe.

Two of our interview participants highlighted this pattern: P1 places mental health 
above all social activity, even with close friends, while P2’s demanding academic 
load has led to increasing social isolation. These examples emphasize that students 
have firm personal limits they are unwilling to compromise.


</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Lack of reason to reach out

Throughout our design research investigating the interaction patterns and barriers
of college students, we found that many students would only initiate social interactions
with their friends over a common ground. Whether that'd be an event, shared interest,
course work, career goals, etc., many students need a common ground and cues to get
started talking. Some cues often relate to these shared qualities between friends
such as instagram reels that remind them of a friend, or an experience that reminds them
of their friend(s). These often serve the basis for reaching out to their friend(s) and
maintaining social connection.


## Iterative Design and Key Insights

After developing our paper prototype from initial sketch feedback, we iteratively refined 
our design through heuristic evaluations and usability testing. These methods revealed two 
major challenges: a lack of clarity around navigation and user control, and unclear affordances 
that made core actions difficult to perform. Participants frequently struggled to understand 
the app’s purpose, feature flows, and how to execute key tasks such as adding friends or 
setting up the DND calendar. Even after initial revisions, usability tests showed persistent 
confusion across many primary features. These insights guided us to strengthen visual cues, 
improve navigation, add walkthroughs, and refine workflows shaping a more intuitive, supportive 
user experience.

### Lack of Clarity and User Control Hindered Navigation


<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x800,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
    }}
    caption={
        "A good caption supports helps a reader understand what is important. " +
        "It thus supports skimming and also provides an emphasis on key points of related text."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}

The majority of our heuristic evaluation feedback centered on issues of user control, freedom, 
and overall clarity. Even though our prototype incorporated familiar visual signals, many 
evaluators struggled to understand the app’s purpose, page flows, and component interactions 
without additional context. Users frequently felt stuck, noting unclear paths for actions 
such as adding friends, allowing/disallowing the app to access text/call information,
and setting up the DND calendar. The DND feature, in particular, was 
widely misunderstood as most participants were unsure of what it was for or how it functioned. 
In response, we incorporated clearer visual cues, more intuitive navigation elements, and 
additional guidance to make key tasks and features easier to understand.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Key Features Lacked Usability and Clear Affordances

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "This caption is applied to the entire block of images. " +
        "See that it spans across the area of the images."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

Despite improvements made after heuristic testing, our usability tests revealed 
persistent confusion across all three sessions. Participants frequently struggled 
to understand how to complete core actions or where to locate key features. 
Adding a friend, for example, remained highly ambiguous (since we had 2 types of + icons).
Futhermore, the visual separation between components lacked clear affordances, 
making it difficult for users to determine how to interact with different elements. 
For example, all testing participants struggled to understandhow to 
import calendar, use the calendar, and the purpose of the calendar within our mockup.
This pattern appeared across nearly all major features. In response, we refined 
the prototype by strengthening visual cues, adding guided walkthroughs, and
simplifying or enhancing workflows to better support users as they navigate essential tasks.




### Privacy and Controlled Access Are Essential

Participants emphasized that any social-support tool must respect strict boundaries around 
personal data. They want full control over what QuackBack can access—whether photos, messages, 
calendars, or interaction logs—and expect the system to use only what they explicitly allow. 
Even helpful features, like automatic detection of interactions, can feel invasive if not clearly 
consented to or easily adjustable. Transparent permissions and the ability to opt in or out at 
any time is crucial. However, that quality of our design was not clear to all our participants,
leading to recurring feedback on concerns despite iterating the design. To address this, we
incorporated walk throughs and added more cues (text) to encourage visibility of this characteristic.
